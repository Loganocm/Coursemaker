We see examples of the first case in Henry Moore's Study for Tube Shelter Perspective, and in the Vincent van Gogh drawings examined earlier. The second case, drawing as preparatory tool, is traditional in Western art, as seen in Michelangelo's detailed studies for his finished painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. A simple, tiny sketch, quickly done, is often the starting point for a far larger and more complex work, as we see in Picasso's studies for his painting Guernica.",

Pastels yield the most exciting results when not overworked. Liquid media like ink and washes allow artists to create drawings with a painterly quality.

      "notes": {
        "summary": "In true fresco, pigments suspended in water are applied to a damp lime-plaster surface. The vehicle is water, and the binder is the lime present in the damp plaster. This makes fresco a highly durable medium, as the pigment becomes an integral part of the wall. Fresco was the favored medium for painting on church walls during the Renaissance in Italy, as seen in the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. Fresco requires careful planning, as changes cannot be made once the paint is applied to the fresh plaster. The luminosity and fine surface quality of fresco make it well-suited for large-scale mural paintings. A related technique, fresco secco, involves applying tempera paint to a dried plaster surface. Fresco experienced a revival in Mexico in the 20th century, with artists like Diego Rivera creating large public murals."
