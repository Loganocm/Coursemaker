It also presents a historical overview of the development of computing systems, from mechanical calculating machines to the modern era of digital computers. The chapter introduces the concept of the computer level hierarchy, which partitions the computer system into different layers of abstraction, from the Digital Logic Level to the User Level. It also discusses the von Neumann model of computing, as well as non-von Neumann architectures and parallel processing.",
