        "summary": "This module introduces the rigid yet comforting routines of the Carr household, seen through the eyes of 'Small.' It details the precise schedule of Sundays, from the rigorous Saturday night baths and toy storage to family prayers, church attendance, and the traditional Sunday walk. The narrator's observations highlight the English influence on their Canadian home and the subtle rebellions against strictures. The module then transitions to the Cow Yard, a vital outdoor space representing freedom, nature, and imaginative play. It explores the different personalities of the sisters, the bond with animals like the Cow and Bong (the Chinaboy), and the lingering mysteries and adventures found within their own property, such as 'The Killing Tree.' The module also touches on early interactions with religious figures like the Bishop and the narrator's unique relationship with singing as an expression of inner joy, often misunderstood by her family. It concludes with an exploration of prayer and the desire for a dog, revealing a child's deep emotional landscape amidst a structured life.",

It begins with the sensory delight of the 'White Currants' bush, symbolizing an almost-revealed secret and a magical world where she rides white horses with an unseen boy, representing a pure, unconstrained form of imagination. The 'Orange Lily' continues this theme, as Small seeks to understand its inner mystery, highlighting her curiosity about the natural world's hidden depths. The module then shifts to her early social struggles, particularly the mortifying 'How Lizzie was Shamed Right Through' incident at a party, revealing the child's raw emotions of shame and her evolving understanding of social etiquette. 'British Columbia Nightingale' shows Small's vivid imagination transforming the croaking of frogs into a terrifying monster, contrasting adult knowledge with childish fear. Finally, 'Time' explores her early philosophical musings on the elasticity of time through the experience of a picnic, where a long afternoon feels like minutes, highlighting her unique way of perceiving the world around her.",

It details her Father's journey from England, through California, to finally settle in Victoria, a 'Crown Colony' then striving to maintain its English character. The module describes the initial homesickness of her Mother in the 'forest' that was only a mile from town, and the transformation of the land from wild Canadian wilderness into a tamed, English-style property with specific imported plants and fences. The physical geography of the James' Bay district is vividly depicted, including the mud flats, the iconic Dallas Road pleasure drive, Beacon Hill Park, and the distant Olympic mountains. It highlights the smells of the mud flats and the beauty of the wild roses. The module also recounts the profound 'Silence' of the Western forests, contrasting it with the sounds of civilization and the determination of 'Pioneers' who toiled to clear and cultivate the land, often in the face of daunting natural obstacles. The stories of early Fort Camosun (Victoria's precursor) and interactions with Indigenous people provide a glimpse into the region's rich past.",

It describes the omnipresent saloons, initially mistaken by Small as belonging to the Navy, and the strict societal rules forbidding children from looking at them. The module differentiates between town saloons and more attractive 'road-houses' along driving roads, which often featured gardens and caged animals, tempting curious children. Transportation is detailed, from the widespread practice of cows roaming plank sidewalks to the various horse-drawn vehicles like chaises and high dog-carts, emphasizing that driving was more for pleasure than speed. It reveals Victoria's unique pace, often deemed 'sleepy' by Americans, and the local preference for durable English goods over 'jerry-built' American ones. The heart of Victoria's commerce is depicted through Father's deep, dark wholesale store on Wharf Street, filled with stacked provisions and presided over by 'wholesale cats.' The module contrasts the orderly, English-influenced business practices with the organic, cow-laid street patterns of the town's outer areas, painting a picture of a developing city clinging to its traditional roots.",

It highlights the custom of 'Visiting Matrons' who brought their entire families for all-day calls, adapting to the lack of easy transportation. The module contrasts the structured social visits with the daily challenges faced by women, particularly in managing households with 'green little Chinese boys' as servants, who were patiently taught Canadian ways while maintaining their own culture. It further delves into the broader interactions between Chinese and Indian populations and the White settlers, noting the different cultural approaches to labor, wealth, and nature. The poignant story of an Indian family rescuing a stranded Chinaman, sharing a 'Cup of Tea' in silent gratitude, underscores themes of inter-cultural aid and universal human needs despite language barriers. This section paints a picture of a developing society where necessity often forged unexpected bonds and revealed underlying human kindness.",

        "summary": "This module provides a detailed look into the public and institutional life of Victorian Victoria, highlighting its religious, educational, and celebratory aspects. It describes the prominence of Christ Church Cathedral and the ideological 'clash of conscience' that led to the formation of the Reformed Episcopal Church, which Small's family attended. Cemetery customs are explored, from the unique features of the Quadra Street Cemetery (Chinese altars, distinct burial sections) to the mournful funeral processions heading to Ross Bay Cemetery. The module critiques Victoria's education system, contrasting the 'ultra-genteel' English Ladies' Academies focused on manners with the 'free school' public system that taught 'book learning.' It touches upon the family's choice to send the younger children to public school despite societal criticism. Christmas traditions are vividly painted, from homemade gifts and fir tree decorations to festive shop windows and plum puddings. The narrative captures the mix of joy, commercial display, and the macabre aspects of a butcher shop at Christmas. Finally, the module details the exhilarating annual Regatta at the Gorge, a significant public event featuring Navy and Indigenous canoe races, concluding with the cruel 'greased pole' pig contest, revealing a less refined side of public entertainment.",

      "notes": {
        "summary": "This final module concludes the narrative by describing the unique 'Characters' who populated Victoria, often eccentric or 'derelict' individuals who found their way to the 'Crown Colony' from England or were part of the local fabric. It highlights the tolerance, if not always understanding, with which Victorians viewed these figures, from homesick 'family remnants' to Elizabeth Pickering and Old Teenie, who embody the city's peculiar charm. The module transitions into the theme of 'Loyalty,' particularly to the Queen and England, as seen through May 24th celebrations and Mrs. Mitchell's deep connection to the Royal Family, which humanized royalty for Small. It then details the city's progress through its changing infrastructure and services: the evolution of healthcare with the 'Doctor and Dentist,' the transition from wells to modern 'Waterworks' and sewerage, and the impact of these changes on daily life and the urban landscape. The 'Chain Gang' exemplifies early civic works, contrasting manual labor with the introduction of machinery. The transformation of 'Cook Street' from a boggy rubbish dump to a paved residential area or Chinese market gardens illustrates the city's constant evolution. Finally, 'Grown Up' reflects on Victoria's growth from a 'lying-down cow' to a developing city, comparing its steady, English-influenced pace to Vancouver's faster, more 'new-world' development, and the eventual modernizations like the Empress Hotel, causeway, and changing harbor, all while retaining its tranquil Island setting.",
