        "summary": "The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) operates as a distinct leadership development program within Virginia Tech, committed to fostering global, ethical leaders. It stands as one of only two senior military colleges integrated within a larger public university in the nation, differentiating itself from federal ROTC programs. While ROTC enrollment requires Corps membership, cadets can choose to be solely in the Corps. The program offers two pathways: the Military-Leader Track for those aspiring to commission into military services, and the Citizen-Leader Track, which applies Corps experiences to careers in private and public sectors. The Corps' organizational structure places deputy commandants as direct supervisors for cadet battalions, serving as crucial advisors, mentors, and disciplinarians. They are the primary contact for families, preferring email communication. However, due to the Federal Privacy Act (FERPA) and university policies, deputy commandants cannot disclose academic grades or health information without a cadet's consent. Families are recognized as vital partners in a cadet's journey, encouraged to support the Corps' higher standards of performance and conduct. This guide aims to address frequent family questions, provide key contacts, and reinforce the long-term benefits of the challenging yet rewarding Corps experience, emphasizing sustained family support.",

Academic success is supported by dedicated Evening Call-to-Quarters (ECQ) study times in residence halls and access to extensive university resources such as the Student Success Center, Writing Center, and Career and Professional Development services. The Corps' own Rice Center for Leader Development provides specific coursework and practical guidance, including a first-year program focused on college transition skills like note-taking and time management. Cadets can further enhance their academic profile by pursuing the Corps' minor in leadership studies and engaging with the Virginia Tech Honors College, where many Corps activities can fulfill honors requirements. Leadership development follows a progressive four-year model, emphasizing 'leading self' in the first year and culminating in 'leading for the future' as seniors. Each year's fall semester focuses on skill acquisition, with spring dedicated to practical application and reflection. Opportunities for leadership enrichment abound, including participation in national leadership conferences, global experiences through programs like the Corps’ Global Scholars and the Olmsted Foundation Undergraduate Scholars, and Department of Defense-funded Project GO for language immersion. The Cutchins Leadership Lecture Series and 'Leaders in Contact' panels regularly host distinguished guest speakers, including Medal of Honor recipients and alumni, to provide inspiration and real-world insights into leadership and ethics.",

The Corps provides several scholarship opportunities, including Emerging Leader Scholarships (ELS) and Commandant’s Scholarships, with a preference often given to Citizen-Leader Track cadets or those not holding an ROTC scholarship. All scholarship recipients are required to annually file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Physical fitness is a foundational element, with all cadets participating in a routine; ROTC cadets must meet specific military service standards, while Citizen-Leader Track cadets must meet Corps standards by their junior year. Extensive wellness resources are available on campus. Schiffert Health Center provides general health care, with most services covered by student health fees. For mental health support, Cook Counseling Center offers confidential individual, couple, and group counseling for stress, anxiety, and other concerns. While counseling information is protected by confidentiality laws (Commonwealth of Virginia), parents can still contact the center or a cadet's deputy commandant to express concerns. Beyond physical and mental health, Virginia Tech's Student Affairs emphasizes holistic development guided by 'Aspirations for Student Learning,' which encourage curiosity, self-understanding, civility, courageous leadership, and embracing 'Ut Prosim' (that I may serve). Students are also encouraged to identify and leverage their natural talents through assessment tools like CliftonStrengths®. The university champions 'Inclusive VT,' fostering a dynamic community that values diversity, belonging, and the unique perspectives of all its members, essential for academic and personal success.",

Central to these is the Cadet Honor Code: 'A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do.' Violations are addressed by the Cadet Honor Court. Hazing is unequivocally prohibited, being a criminal offense in Virginia and antithetical to positive leadership. Allegations are reported to law enforcement and university offices, leading to severe sanctions up to suspension or dismissal from the Corps, in addition to any university or state penalties. Mutual respect and safety are paramount, with no tolerance for harassment or assault, which may incur criminal sanctions. The alcohol policy is exceptionally strict, mirroring university policy but with more immediate and severe consequences. Underage consumption, irresponsible consumption by legal-age cadets, and possession of false identification are strictly forbidden. Possession of a false ID is also an Honor Code violation. All alcohol incidents are adjudicated, and repeat offenses can lead to suspension or dismissal from the Corps. Any alcohol-related incident can negatively impact a cadet's standing in ROTC programs and their suitability for commissioning, including loss of scholarships. Cadets are required to report violations and formally acknowledge their understanding of alcohol, hazing, and sexual harassment/assault policies. The Corps also has a specific withdrawal policy: first-semester cadets leaving before October 4th must withdraw from the university for that semester, though they can re-enroll as civilian students in the spring. Upper-class and second-semester first-year cadets can request a status change at any time, with considerations for housing contracts.",

        "summary": "Cadets in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets adhere to specific regulations for leaving campus, differentiating between a 'pass' for travel within a 50-mile radius (expiring at midnight) and 'leave' for travel beyond this distance. 'Closed weekends' are designated periods with mandatory Corps events, during which overnight leave is generally not approved, though exceptions are made for significant family events, emergencies, or academic commitments. First-year cadets, in particular, may find their leave opportunities limited until Thanksgiving break due to the demanding training schedule. All cadets are required to depart campus within 24 hours of completing their last final exam. Beyond standard leave, specific key events shape the cadet experience. These include formal Parades and Retreats held on Upper Quad and the Drillfield, which showcase regimental discipline. A significant rite of passage is the Caldwell March, a 26-mile trek completed in two 13-mile phases (fall and spring) that serves as a capstone training event for first-year cadets. Cadets also have mandatory attendance at all home football games, where they march-on with the regiment and sit in a designated Corps seating section. Regarding logistics, after New Cadet Week, all mail and package deliveries are managed through VT Mail Services.
