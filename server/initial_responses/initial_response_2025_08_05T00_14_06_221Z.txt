      "notes": {
        "summary": "This module deeply explores the strict, ritualized domestic life of a Victorian child named Small, likely Emily Carr herself, in Victoria, BC. Sundays are depicted as rigidly structured, from the meticulous Saturday night baths with \"brown Windsor soap\" and cold house dashes, to stiff church clothes, lengthy sermons, and solemn evening Bible readings. The Father's stern, English-centric demeanor dictates much of the household's routine, emphasizing order and piety. However, Small finds solace and joy in the \"Cow Yard,\" a space of freedom and connection with animals like the Cow, rooster, and hens, where her uninhibited \"cow-songs\" often contrast with her family's social anxieties. Her relationship with the \"Praying Chair\" highlights a child's imaginative coping with unmet desires, while the \"Killing Tree\" offers an early, unsettling encounter with death and mystery. Social lessons, such as Lizzie's shame over Small's boisterous party behavior, underscore the pervasive emphasis on proper conduct. Through these experiences, the module paints a vivid picture of a childhood navigating the tension between rigid societal expectations and personal expression.",

It describes the raw beauty of the Westâ€”from the profound silence of its forests to the vibrant wild lilies and a unique perspective on time, where a stream can compress an afternoon into a minute. The narrative covers the challenging pioneer experience of clearing land, contrasting with the child's playful explorations of ditches and meadows. It delves into specific geographical features like James' Bay, Dallas Road, and Beacon Hill Park, highlighting their distinct characteristics and the interplay between natural elements and human endeavors. The evolution of infrastructure, such as the gradual development of Cook Street from a garbage dump to a paved road, and the transition from wells to piped water systems, illustrates Victoria's journey towards modernization. The child's observations often imbue these physical spaces and processes with wonder, fear, or personal meaning, revealing a unique perception of the world around her, from the unseen \"nightingale monster\" to the transformation of humble garbage into foundational street.",

The narrative vividly portrays daily customs, such as matronly visits with large families, diverse transportation methods, and the strict societal rules governing everything from saloon visits to funeral processions. It explores the commercial heart of the town through Father's wholesale store, highlighting interactions with Indigenous traders and the presence of Chinatown. The module also delves into the unique cultural dynamics between English settlers, Chinese laborers, and Indigenous peoples, showing both collaboration and misunderstanding. Community events like Christmas celebrations and the annual Regatta are described, revealing the blend of tradition, entertainment, and underlying social stratification. Through these detailed vignettes, the module illuminates the evolving social norms, class distinctions, and the persistent \"Englishness\" that defined Victoria's identity, all filtered through a child's often humorous or bewildered perspective.",

        "summary": "This module encapsulates Victoria's transition from a sleepy \"Old Country\"-loyal town to a growing, modern city, as seen through the lens of memory and change. It vividly contrasts Victoria's initial slow pace and strong English identity with the rapid development of its rival, Vancouver, and the eventual modernization that reshaped its landscape. Key transformations include the building of grand Parliament Buildings, the replacement of the old wooden James' Bay bridge with a concrete causeway, and the construction of the iconic Empress Hotel on reclaimed land that was once a garbage dump. These changes, driven partly by the Canadian Pacific Railway, signify Victoria's reluctant embrace of progress and a shift from its strict colonial past. The module notes the disappearance of old landmarks, social customs, and even the natural features, such as the Gorge becoming industrialized. While Victoria maintains its tranquil, deliberate nature, it acknowledges its evolution from a \"lying-down cow\" chewing cud to a city adapting to the demands of the West, demonstrating a complex legacy of preserving tradition amidst inevitable growth.",
