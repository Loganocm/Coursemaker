        "summary": "This chapter provides a brief introduction to the basics of logic design. It covers Boolean algebra and its relationship to logic gates and basic digital circuits. Understanding how Boolean logic affects the design of various computer system components will allow the student to use any computer system more effectively, even if they never have to design digital circuits or other physical components themselves.",

        {
          "question": "What is a truth table and how is it used?",
          "answer": "A truth table shows the relationship between the input values and the result of a specific Boolean operator or function on the input variables. It is used to completely describe the behavior of a Boolean operator or function."

          "question": "What is the difference between sum-of-products and product-of-sums forms for representing Boolean functions?",
          "answer": "The sum-of-products form requires the expression to be a collection of ANDed variables (or product terms) that are ORed together. The product-of-sums form consists of ORed variables (sum terms) that are ANDed together. The sum-of-products form is usually easier to work with and simplify."

          "question": "How are Boolean expressions related to digital circuits?",
          "answer": "There is a one-to-one correspondence between a Boolean expression and its implementation using electrical circuits. Unnecessary terms in the expression lead to unnecessary components in the physical circuit, which yields a suboptimal circuit."
