        "summary": "The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) is a distinguished leadership development program, committed to molding global, ethical leaders. Unique as one of only two senior military colleges integrated within a larger public university, VTCC operates separately from federal ROTC programs. While ROTC enrollment requires Corps membership, cadets can pursue the Corps experience independently. The program provides two distinct pathways: the Military-Leader Track, designed for commissioning into military services, and the Citizen-Leader Track, which applies Corps leadership principles to careers in the private and public sectors. Cadets have the flexibility to transition between these tracks as their career aspirations evolve. The Corps' organizational structure centers around the Commandant, supported by Deputy Commandants, who oversee the daily supervision of cadet battalions. These Deputy Commandants serve as the most direct point of contact for families, acting as crucial advisors, mentors, counselors, supervisors, and disciplinarians. It is important for families to understand that due to the Federal Privacy Act (FERPA) and university policies, Deputy Commandants cannot divulge private student information such as grades or health details without explicit cadet consent. However, they are dedicated to partnering with families and cadets to navigate the complexities of university, Corps, and personal demands. The Corps deeply values family support, recognizing the significant challenge and immense rewards cadets undertake. Families are encouraged to reinforce the higher standards of conduct and performance expected of cadets, acknowledging that this commitment earns them respect. Your continued support and long-term perspective are vital in helping cadets make choices that align with their full potential, even when facing difficulties.",

Cadets adhere to structured study times, Evening Call-to-Quarters (ECQ), ensuring focused academic priority in residence halls, with flexibility for external study. Virginia Tech offers extensive free academic resources like the Student Success Center, Writing Center, and Career and Professional Development. The Corps' Rice Center for Leader Development directly supports cadets through coursework, practical leadership opportunities, ethics training, and guest speakers. First-year cadets participate in an accredited leader development course that aids in college transition, covering essential skills like note-taking and time management, and benefit from peer mentoring by successful upper-class cadets. For deeper engagement, cadets can declare the Corps' Leadership Studies minor, integrating Corps/ROTC/Citizen-Leader courses, business/ethics classes, and mandatory leadership roles. Strong collaboration with the Virginia Tech Honors College allows eligible cadets to apply Corps activities towards Honors diplomas and certifications. The Corps fosters a progressive, four-year leadership development model: first-year focuses on 'leading self,' sophomore on 'leading people,' junior on 'leading organizations,' and senior on 'leading for the future,' with fall semesters for skill learning and spring for application. Cadets gain invaluable experience through participation in national leadership conferences and diverse global opportunities. These include the Corps’ Global Scholars Program, offering a seminar and overseas battlefield trips funded by alumni, the Olmsted Foundation Undergraduate Scholars program for foreign cultural understanding, and ROTC-specific Project GO, which provides fully funded language and regional study abroad. The Cutchins Leadership Lecture Series and Leaders in Contact panels regularly feature notable speakers, including Medal of Honor recipients and Corps alumni, who share insights on leadership, ethics, and career application, enriching the overall developmental experience.",

ELS can be suspended or lost due to disciplinary action or early departure. Beyond the first year, cadets become eligible to compete for Commandant’s Scholarships, which are generally prioritized for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or those without an ROTC scholarship, with selection based on a holistic review. Additional financial opportunities for rising juniors and seniors in good standing include the Major General and Mrs. Randy Fullhart Horizon Fund. The Commandant’s Response Scholarship Fund exists to provide aid during unforeseen financial crises. A crucial requirement for all cadets receiving any scholarship is the annual submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), even if no other financial aid is being received. This ensures compliance with federal regulations and helps the university track student financial needs. Families interested in contributing to the Corps' mission through scholarship support or other philanthropic endeavors are encouraged to contact Kelley Corvin, highlighting the vital role of donations in sustaining these opportunities for cadets.",

Central to this is the Cadet Honor Code: 'A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do.' Violations are met with significant sanctions. Hazing is strictly forbidden as a criminal offense and antithetical to leadership; allegations are reported and can lead to suspension or dismissal from the Corps, plus university or state penalties. Mutual respect and safety are paramount; harassment and assault are not tolerated and may incur criminal sanctions. The Corps' alcohol policy is notably stringent, with immediate and severe repercussions for underage or irresponsible consumption, and possession of a false ID is an Honor Code violation. All alcohol-related incidents are adjudicated, with cadets required to report violations. A first alcohol offense can lead to a year of military probation and scholarship loss; a second, a one-year Corps suspension; a third, dismissal. Assisting underage cadets in acquiring alcohol can also result in dismissal. Corps sanctions are always accompanied by university sanctions and can negatively impact ROTC standing, scholarships, and commissioning eligibility. Cadets must sign an Acknowledgment of Understanding for key policies. The Withdrawal Policy states that first-semester cadets leaving the Corps before October 4th must withdraw from the university for that semester, though they can re-enroll as civilian students in spring. Upper-class cadets can request civilian status change anytime, potentially remaining in cadet halls under Corps rules if civilian housing isn't immediately available.",

        "summary": "The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets participates in numerous traditional and mandatory university activities throughout the academic year. Key events include public Parades and Formal Retreats, showcasing regimental discipline. The Caldwell March, a 26-mile, two-part trek, serves as a capstone for first-year cadet training, with families welcome at its conclusion. Cadets must attend all home football games, marching in with the regiment and sitting in designated Corps seating in the South End Zone; visitors are not permitted in this section. Campus departures involve requesting a 'pass' (within 50 miles) or 'leave' (beyond 50 miles), requiring specific approvals. A 'Family Pass' allows first-year cadets overnight hotel stays with visiting family, generally after mandatory Corps functions on 'closed weekends.' These 'Closed Weekends' restrict overnight leave, except for verified major family events or emergencies. While cadets observe all university holidays, first-years may have limited leave until Thanksgiving due to training. All students must depart within 24 hours of their last final. For mail, new cadets use a specific CLMS address only during New Cadet Week; afterward, all mail and packages go through VT Mail Services to residence hall addresses. Visiting families must adhere to campus parking rules, utilizing paid options like the North End Center garage. The guide provides important 2024-2025 dates (move-in, classes, holidays, Corps events, finals, graduation) and essential contact information for Deputy Commandants, administrative, and ROTC offices, plus social media links for family reference.",
