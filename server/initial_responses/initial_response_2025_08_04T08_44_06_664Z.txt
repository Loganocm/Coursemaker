Sundays commence with Father's early morning summons, followed by formal family prayers characterized by \"awe-ful words.\" No work is permitted; all food is cooked beforehand. The family, dressed in stiff, uncomfortable attire, embarks on a long, straight walk to Dr. Reid's Presbyterian church. Small often struggles with wakefulness during the lengthy sermon. Post-church, the Sunday dinner consists of a cold saddle of mutton, prepared in Father's English-style oven, accompanied by unique side dishes and a massive cottage-loaf of bread. A mandatory sermon recall follows dinner, where children recount details to Father's satisfaction. The afternoon transitions to Sunday School taught by Dede and a family walk across their English-styled property, contrasted sharply by the nearby \"Park Hotel,\" a saloon that profoundly displeases Father. The day concludes with tea and a prolonged, mandatory Bible reading, which the younger children, including Small, find particularly challenging due to sleepiness, before a brief serial story brings the day to a close.", "keywords": ["Sunday routine", "Presbyterianism", "Anglicanism", "Family prayers", "Dr. Reid", "Sermon", "Cold mutton", "Sunday School", "Dede", "Father", "Park Hotel", "Bible reading", "Childhood memories", "Victorian era"]}, "flashcards": [{"question": "What was the primary difference between Father's and Mother's religious practices?", "answer": "Father's was strict Presbyterian on Sunday mornings, while Mother's was gentler Anglican on Sunday evenings."}, {"question": "What was the main source of Father's displeasure regarding his property's corner acre?", "answer": "Mrs. Lush built a \"Public House\" (saloon) there, breaking her promise not to."}], "quiz": [{"question": "What type of church did the Carr family attend on Sunday mornings?", "options": {"A": "Anglican", "B": "Methodist", "C": "Presbyterian", "D": "Baptist"}, "correctAnswer": "C"}]}, {"moduleTitle": "Module 3: The Cow Yard", "notes": {"summary": "This module provides a vivid portrayal of the \"Cow Yard,\" a significant space for play and exploration for Small and her older sisters, Bigger and Middle. The yard's vastness is defined not just by its physical dimensions but also by the \"spirit of maternity\" hovering above it, embodying the gentle, life-giving presence of the large, red-and-white Cow. Key features of the yard include the old and new barns, a pond where the girls fish for tadpoles, and a rock-bordered ditch with two bridges. The narrative highlights seasonal events, particularly the Spring bonfire, a central gathering where orchard prunings and winter debris are burned. During this event, the girls roast potatoes and engage in imaginative storytelling, revealing their distinct future aspirations: Bigger's missionary calling, Middle's desire for a large doll family, and Small's yearning for a circus life or marrying a farmer with many animals, contrasting her practical views with Bigger's idealism. The module also covers the natural cycle of the farm, including the hatching of fluffy chickens and a memorable instance of a hen raising ducklings. Small's attempt to ride the placid Cow, motivated by a desire for a \"colt,\" hilariously backfires, resulting in a fall. A more somber element is the \"Killing Tree,\" an ivy-covered tree believed to mysteriously kill birds, a source of childhood fear and curiosity that is eventually cut down, its enigma remaining unsolved. The module concludes with the Father acquiring a horse, but the Cow's enduring dominance ensures the space remains affectionately known as \"The Cow Yard.\"", "keywords": ["Cow Yard", "Childhood play", "Bonfire", "Storytelling", "Hen", "Ducklings", "Killing Tree", "Ivy", "Cow", "Horse", "Animal behavior", "Imaginative play", "Farm life", "Sister dynamics"]}, "flashcards": [{"question": "What did Small, Bigger, and Middle do during the bonfire?", "answer": "They roasted potatoes and told stories about their future aspirations."}, {"question": "What was the \"Killing Tree\" believed to do?", "answer": "It was believed to silently kill sparrows and other creatures that entered its dense ivy."}], "quiz": [{"question": "What was Small's primary aspiration discussed during the bonfire story-telling?", "options": {"A": "To be a missionary", "B": "To have a hundred children", "C": "To join a circus or marry a farmer with many animals", "D": "To own a large vegetable garden"}, "correctAnswer": "C"}]}, {"moduleTitle": "Module 4: The Bishop and the Canary", "notes": {"summary": "This module intimately explores Small's pure joy and overwhelming sense of connection upon receiving her first live creature, a little canary with a distinctive topknot. The experience is profoundly personal for Small, who feels an almost divine responsibility and whispers, \"Mine! I shall be his God.\" Her excitement is so intense that her movements become careful, yet she yearns to share her newfound treasure. Her opportunity arises when she encounters the Bishop, a figure of great holiness whom Small holds in awe. Believing that birds, belonging to the sky, would be understood by the holy man, Small bravely approaches him, holding the cage high and eagerly calling out. However, the Bishop's thoughts are distant, focused on higher contemplations. Despite Small's earnest attempts to attract his attention and share her joy, he remains oblivious to the significance of the moment for her. He offers a kind but vague compliment about her being \"a pretty picture\" and gently moves her out of his path. This dismissive encounter leaves Small with a powerful, unspoken \"hurt fury,\" deeply disappointed by the Bishop's inability to recognize or engage with her profound joy and the wonder of her cherished new pet.

In stark contrast, the evening Anglican service was considered a special treat, located much closer to their home near James' Bay mud flats. Attending this service meant being out at night, a rare and magical experience under the moon and stars, with twinkling town and harbor lights. The Anglican church environment is depicted as \"mellow,\" presided over by a mild, wide Bishop whose soft, moon-like voice and unique blessing were the highlight. The children eagerly anticipated this blessing, daring not to nap through it despite the comfortable pews. The church itself was beautiful, with music from an organ, splendid chandeliers casting light, and a mixed choir. The Bishop's sermon, though read from sheets, was delivered with a gentle \"Amen.\" The departure from this service was marked by a feeling of carrying \"a bit of the Bishop's blessing\" home, emphasizing the profound emotional and spiritual impact of the evening ritual compared to the more rigid and dutiful morning one.", "keywords": ["Presbyterianism", "Anglicanism", "Religious contrast", "Bishop", "Church service", "Blessing", "James' Bay", "Childhood experience", "Formality", "Spiritual comfort", "Family life", "Sermon", "Organ music", "Choir"]}, "flashcards": [{"question": "What feature of the Anglican service did the children most look forward to?", "answer": "The Bishop's blessing."}, {"question": "How did the evening Anglican church differ geographically from the morning Presbyterian church?", "answer": "The Anglican church was much nearer their house, down over Marvin's Hill, while the Presbyterian church required a long walk."}], "quiz": [{"question": "What characteristic best describes the Anglican Bishop's voice?", "options": {"A": "Loud and booming", "B": "Gentle and moon-like", "C": "Harsh and demanding", "D": "Quick and hurried"}, "correctAnswer": "B"}]}, {"moduleTitle": "Module 6: Singing", "notes": {"summary": "This module explores Small's uninhibited, joyful singing, which her family, especially Bigger, disapproves of, calling it a \"horrible row\" that shames them.

Bigger's constant scolding about the \"vulgar row\" and fears of what neighbors think contrast sharply with Small's unapologetic expression. Even the Elder attempts to shame Small by recounting an incident where a lady mistook Small's singing for someone in \"trouble.\" The Bishop also offers a gentle, albeit detached, comment on her singing. Later, during her siblings' holiday absence, Small observes her mother and Mrs. Gregory, usually prim and proper, unexpectedly singing old English songs.

Despite her mother's dismissal of the idea, Small's birthday approaches with hints of a \"d\" or \"p\" present. Her excitement is palpable as she prepares for a puppy, even finding an old hairbrush and crafting a collar. However, her present is a picture of a girl with a dog, crushing her hopes.

The Crane house is described as being \"backwards\" (front door at the back, facing the sea), and filled with Mr. Crane's hunting trophies, unsettling Small. Mrs. Crane's children are formal and well-behaved, a stark contrast to Small's own uninhibited nature. Small finds comfort only in the Cranes' old, retired dog, who is not used for hunting. The strict rules, particularly about dolls and wild dogs, and an unsettling story from Helen about her father shooting a beloved mongrel, further emphasize the differences. Small is caught in a mischievous act (playing with quicksilver) and later, a well-intentioned but disastrous attempt to give castor oil to a sick hen, leading to chaos and Mrs. Crane's cold disapproval. Small's emotional distress is palpable, culminating in her declaring she \"hates\" Mrs. Crane and believes she has a \"pig's heart,\" yet later sees a momentary beauty in her, recognizing her depth.
