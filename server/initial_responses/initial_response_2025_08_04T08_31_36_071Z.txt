        "summary": "This module introduces the Carr family's meticulously structured Sunday routine, primarily from the perspective of 'Small' (Emily Carr herself as a child). It highlights the strict Presbyterian observances influenced by Father's English traditions, including the Saturday night bath, formal Sunday morning prayers, and the long walk to Dr. Reid's church. The module details the specific Sunday dinner (cold saddle of mutton) and the mandatory sermon recall session, which reveals the distinct personalities of the older sisters. It also touches on Mother's more gentle Anglican preferences for Sunday evenings and the children's Sunday School under Dede. The family's Sunday walk on their carefully cultivated 'English' property leads to Father's intense displeasure at Mrs. Lush's nearby public house. The module concludes with the nightly Bible reading and Father's strict adherence to finishing chapters, followed by a lighter moment with a serial story before bed, showcasing the contrasting elements of a Victorian childhood.",

The Cow Yard, dominated by the large, red-and-white Cow, serves as a backdrop for various seasonal activities and childhood observations. It describes the bond between Bong (the Chinaboy) and the Cow, and the children's adventures at the Pond Place. A key event is the annual spring bonfire, where the children roast potatoes and share their dreams for the future, highlighting their distinct personalities: Bigger's idealism, Middle's maternal nature, and Small's practical, animal-loving spirit. The module introduces the ominous 'Killing Tree,' an ivy-covered tree that mysteriously silences sparrows, creating a sense of foreboding and exploring Small's early confrontation with death and unanswered questions. It concludes with the arrival of a horse, initially challenging the Cow's dominance but ultimately confirming the yard's enduring identity.",

The Sunday morning Presbyterian service is depicted as an arduous endurance test, characterized by long walks, prayers, and sermons, yet imbued with a sense of 'rightness.' In stark contrast, the Sunday evening Anglican service, held in a closer, more 'mellow' church, is a cherished 'privilege.' This service offers comfort, music from an organ lady, and the distinct presence of a mild, gentle Bishop whose blessing is anticipated and deeply felt by the children. The module highlights the sensory details of both experiences, from the clatter of horse hooves and the smell of mud flats to the flickering gas jets and echoing music of the Anglican church, emphasizing how the Bishop's blessing resonated with the children.",

The conflict with her older sister, Bigger, over the 'vulgar row' highlights Small's stubborn determination to express her happiness. A surprising turning point comes during her siblings' holiday absence, when Small observes her usually prim mother and Mrs. Gregory sing old songs, revealing a hidden, emotional depth and connection to their English past. This experience validates Small's own desire to sing freely, prompting her to continue her 'cow-yard songs' directly to her mother's window, regardless of her sisters' disapproval, suggesting a deeper understanding of emotional expression.",

Small's desire for a dog, a longing she's held since 'the beginning of the world,' becomes intertwined with the chair's perceived power to 'amen' prayers. Despite her attempts to use the chair to wish for a puppy and the initial disappointments, including a birthday gift of a picture of a dog instead of a real one, her desire persists throughout years of adulthood and family disapproval, especially from the Elder. The module traces the eventual fulfillment of her wish when, as a middle-aged woman, she acquires her first dog, and later, a kennel of Bobtail Sheepdogs. The symbolic return of the old 'praying chair' to her dog nursery provides a poignant full circle, as it 'amens' her adult life filled with the animals she always desired, contrasting with the childhood strictures.",

The Crane household is a study in contrasts: a house with a backward layout, a father who hunts animals for 'sport,' and children who are formally polite yet engage in rule-breaking with Small. Key events include the unsettling display of stuffed animals, Mr. Crane's quicksilver escapade, and the children's joy riding Cricket, the pinto pony. Small’s growing discomfort with Mrs. Crane's rigidity and selective kindness is evident in incidents like the antimacassar braiding and the hen being given castor oil. Despite the initial negativity, Small's perspective subtly shifts by the end, seeing a 'most beautiful woman' in Mrs. Crane, suggesting a complex understanding of her host.",

        "summary": "This module transports the reader to a special, almost magical corner of the old garden, where Small's imagination takes flight. It centers around the white currant bush, whose clear, ripening berries are likened to 'almost-told secrets,' hinting at a deeper, unseen life. Adjacent to the currants is a 'little spare place' filled with a half-wild, mauvy-pink flower called Rocket, whose scent attracts millions of butterflies and bees, creating a vibrant, trembling atmosphere. This sensory rich environment becomes the stage for Small's unique imaginary world: flying round and round on white horses with an unseen boy whose name she knows. This beautiful, unified 'secret' is on the verge of full revelation, described as getting 'clearer and clearer every moment.' However, the spell is abruptly broken by a grown-up's call, shattering the magical experience and bringing Small back to the mundane reality of garden chores.",

        "summary": "This module describes Small's visit to Henry and Anne Mitchell's nursery garden, focusing on her captivated encounter with a vibrant Orange Lily. Small's detailed observation of the lily—its cool, slippery petals, rust-powdered stamens, and powerful perfume—reveals her deep connection to living nature, contrasting sharply with Anne Mitchell's preference for 'everlasting flowers,' dried and used for wreaths. Anne's house, filled with dull light and heavy, dusty air from the drying flowers, represents a more somber, static approach to beauty and life, associated with preparing for 'the winter's dead.' Small's persistent fascination with the alive, yet empty, trumpet of the Orange Lily, even after Anne attempts to distract her with prepared posies and criticisms of the lily's 'gaudy' nature, highlights Small's unique perception and her internal absorption of the lily's essence as a 'soundless, formless, white' burning image in her heart.",

        "summary": "This module humorously recounts Small's first-ever party experience at the Langleys' house, primarily through the mortified perspective of her older sister, Lizzie. Lizzie, aged eight, is acutely aware of proper Victorian etiquette and attempts to control four-year-old Small's behavior, but to no avail. Small's uninhibited actions—from dirtying her gloves in the cab to loudly expressing thoughts and stuffing her cheeks with cake—cause Lizzie immense 'shame right through.' The party involves a ride in Mr. Winter's picnic carriage to Foul Bay beach for games, followed by an awkward tea where Small's 'misbehavior' escalates. Despite Lizzie's efforts to instill politeness, Small remains unashamed, prioritizing her own experiences and desires over social graces. The module vividly portrays the clash between a rigid upbringing and a child's natural, unconstrained spirit, culminating in Lizzie's dramatic declaration that she will 'never, never, never' take Small to a party again.",
