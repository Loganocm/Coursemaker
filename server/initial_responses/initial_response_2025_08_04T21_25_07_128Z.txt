It delves into the strict Sunday observances, including mandatory church attendance, family prayers, and the unique 'Sunday walk' around their property. We learn about the household structure, featuring the diligent Chinaboy, Bong, and the omnipresent presence of Father's English traditions. The module also highlights the lively 'Cow Yard' as a central playground and source of wonder, contrasting Small's connection to animals with her sisters' more conventional play. Themes of familial love, childhood curiosity, the complexities of religious upbringing, and the often-unspoken emotional world of a child are woven throughout. Small's unique perspectives, such as her joy in singing to the cow despite family disapproval, or her deep desire for a pet dog, offer insights into her developing personality and artistic sensibility, revealing a spirit that chafed against strictures while cherishing moments of natural beauty and genuine connection.", "keywords": ["Sunday routines", "family prayers", "Father's rules", "Cow Yard", "bonfire", "pet canary", "Bishop Cridge", "Anglican Church", "Presbyterian Church", "joyful singing", "praying chair", "dog desire", "childhood wonder", "Victorian home life", "Emily Carr"]}, "flashcards": [{"question": "What two books were allowed on Sundays in Small's home?", "answer": "The Peep of Day and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress."}, {"question": "What was Father's distinct 'Sunday smell'?", "answer": "Wright’s coal-tar soap and camphor."}, {"question": "What was the name of the Chinaboy who worked for Small's family?", "answer": "Bong."}, {"question": "What was the main dish for Sunday dinner at the Carr house?", "answer": "Cold saddle of mutton."}, {"question": "What was the 'Killing Tree' in the Cow Yard?", "answer": "An ivy-covered tree where birds mysteriously died, perceived as sinister by Small."}, {"question": "What animal did Small attempt to ride in the Cow Yard, resulting in a fall?", "answer": "The Cow."}, {"question": "What was Small's first live creature she ever owned?", "answer": "A canary with a topknot."}, {"question": "What did Small initially believe nightingales to be?", "answer": "Enormous monsters due to their loud croaking sound."}, {"question": "What was the primary method of bathing for the family on Saturday nights?", "answer": "In an enormous wooden tub in the kitchen."}, {"question": "What was the Bishop's favorite word, used as a slow contemplation?", "answer": "Ah!"}, {"question": "What kind of song did Bong sing to the Cow while milking?", "answer": "A Chinese song in a falsetto voice."}, {"question": "What did Small wish for more than anything, praying for it using the 'praying chair'?", "answer": "A puppy/dog."}], "quiz": [{"question": "Which of the following activities was NOT permitted on Sundays in the Carr household?", "options": {"A": "Reading Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress", "B": "Playing with toys and dolls", "C": "Having family prayers", "D": "Taking a Sunday walk"}, "correctAnswer": "B"}, {"question": "What distinguished the Bishop's Anglican service from Father's Presbyterian service for the children?", "options": {"A": "The Anglican church was further away.", "B": "The Anglican service had more music and was a 'treat'.", "C": The Bishop was a much stricter preacher.", "D": "They did not have to attend the Anglican service."}, "correctAnswer": "B"}, {"question": "What was the significance of the bonfire in the Cow Yard?", "options": {"A": "It was a weekly event to dispose of farm waste.", "B": "It marked the beginning of spring and was a time for roasting potatoes and storytelling.", "C": "It was used to scare away wild animals from the pasture.", "D": "It symbolized the family's strict adherence to cleanliness."}, "correctAnswer": "B"}, {"question": "How did Small attempt to make the cat, Tibby, 'amen' to her prayer for a puppy?", "options": {"A": "She whispered the prayer into Tibby's ear.", "B": "She placed Tibby's paw on the Bible.", "C": "She poked Tibby underneath the cage-like base of the praying chair, pinching her tail.", "D": "She promised Tibby treats if she barked like a dog."}, "correctAnswer": "C"}, {"question": "What was Small's mother's reaction to Small's 'cow-songs'?", "options": {"A": "She scolded Small for being vulgar like Bigger.", "B": "She told Small to sing quietly indoors.", "C": "She loved Small's happy songs and said her voice would be trained someday.", "D": "She was embarrassed by Small's singing in front of the Bishop."}, "correctAnswer": "C"}]}, {"moduleTitle": "Module 2: Childhood Adventures and Encounters", "notes": {"summary": "This module transitions Small's narrative to experiences beyond her immediate home, focusing on external adventures and the maturation of her understanding.
