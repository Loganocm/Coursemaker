Saturday nights were dedicated to preparations, including bathing in a large wooden tub and putting away toys. Sundays began with Father's camphor scent and solemn family prayers, followed by church attendance at Dr. Reid's Presbyterian Church. Father, a staunch Englishman, valued order and tradition, evident in the cold mutton Sunday dinner and the rigorous sermon recitation. Mother, being more delicate, preferred the Anglican evening service, which was a gentler privilege. The module highlights the contrast between the rigid Presbyterian observances and the more relaxed, musical Anglican services, and the protagonist Small's personal experiences, including her rebellious spirit against the strictures and her vivid observations of family members and surroundings like the 'lily field.' The chapter 'The Blessing' reinforces the hybrid religious life, emphasizing the differing atmospheres of morning Presbyterian services and evening Anglican ones, and the symbolic 'blessing' carried home.", "keywords": ["Sunday rituals", "Presbyterian Church", "Anglican Church", "Dr. Reid", "Bible reading", "Family prayers", "Lily field", "Saddle of mutton", "Emily Carr", "Victoria, BC", "Bong", "Mother", "Father", "Dede"]}, "flashcards": [{"question": "What was the main difference between Father's and Mother's preferred Sunday church services?", "answer": "Father preferred the strict, long Presbyterian service, while Mother preferred the gentler, musical Anglican evening service."}, {"question": "What book and toy were allowed on Sunday, and what was stored away?", "answer": "Only 'The Peep of Day' and 'Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress' were allowed; other toys, dolls, and books were stored until Monday."}, {"question": "How did Father decide who would start the sermon recitation after dinner?", "answer": "He would look up and down the table and pick the 'squirmiest' child."}, {"question": "What unique feature did the family's lily field possess?", "answer": "The lilies did something to the back of one's eyes and nose, making them seem always present in memory and scent."}], "quiz": [{"question": "Which of the following was NOT a characteristic of Sunday mornings in the Carr household?", "options": {"A": "Bathing using a large wooden tub and brown Windsor soap.", "B": "Father smelling of Wright’s coal-tar soap and camphor.", "C": "Family prayers with 'awe-ful' words Father understood.", "D": "Bong the Chinaboy working throughout the day."}, "correctAnswer": "D"}, {"question": "What did Father sell to Mrs. Lush that caused him great distress?", "options": {"A": "A section of the family garden for a private residence.", "B": "A corner acre of land adjacent to Beacon Hill Park.", "C": "His personal camphor-wood chest.", "D": "The family's enormous mutton oven."}, "correctAnswer": "B"}]}, {"moduleTitle": "Module 2: The World of the Cow Yard and Animal Interactions", "notes": {"summary": "This module delves into the significant role of the Cow Yard in Small's childhood, a space teeming with life and distinct seasons.
