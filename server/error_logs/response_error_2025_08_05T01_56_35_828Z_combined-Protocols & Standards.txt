  "notes": "## Protocols & Standards\n\nThis chapter outlines essential policies and standards governing cadet conduct, safety, and academic standing within the Corps.\n\n### 1. Cadet Honor Code\n*   **Core Principle:** Upholding unwavering integrity, honesty, and a strong moral compass.\n*   **Expectation:** Cadets are expected to embody the principle: 'I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do.' This code is fundamental to fostering trust and respect within the Corps community.\n\n### 2. Policy on Hazing\n*   **Definition (Implicit):** Any activity that intends to cause humiliation, physical or emotional harm, or creates a hostile, intimidating, or demeaning environment, often as a condition for membership or status within the Corps.\n*   **Key Classifications & Consequences:\n    *   **Criminal Offense:** Hazing is a serious crime under state and federal law, leading to potential legal prosecution.\n    *   **University Policy Violation:** It is strictly prohibited by all university regulations, regardless of legal action.\n    *   **Disciplinary Actions:** Violators will face severe disciplinary measures from the university, which may include suspension, expulsion, and other penalties, in addition to potential criminal charges.\n\n### 3. Mutual Respect and Safety\n*   **Core Principle:** Fostering an inclusive environment of dignity, respect, and physical/emotional safety for all individuals.\n*   **Prohibited Behaviors:\n    *   **Harassment:** Any unwelcome verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, sexual orientation) that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.\n    *   **Assaults:** Prohibits all forms of physical assault, sexual assault, or any act that threatens the physical safety or well-being of another person. These are considered grave offenses with severe consequences.\n\n### 4. Alcohol Policy\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure responsible conduct and adherence to legal standards regarding alcohol consumption by cadets.\n*   **Prohibited Actions:\n    *   **Underage Consumption:** Strictly forbidden for any cadet under the legal drinking age, regardless of location.\n    *   **Irresponsible Consumption:** Includes, but is not limited to, binge drinking, public intoxication, impaired judgment, or any consumption that leads to unsafe behavior or disruption of the Corps environment.\n    *   **False Identification:** Using, possessing, or manufacturing false identification to purchase or consume alcohol is strictly prohibited.\n*   **Reporting Violations:** Cadets are expected to report violations of the alcohol policy to appropriate Corps or university authorities.\n*   **Sanctions:** Violations will result in disciplinary actions, which can range from warnings and educational interventions to suspension or expulsion.\n*   **ROTC Implications:** Violations may also have specific implications for a cadet's standing and future in ROTC programs, potentially affecting scholarships, commissions, or participation opportunities.\n\n### 5. Sanctions for Violations of Corps Policies\n*   **General Principle:** Violations of any Corps policy (including the Honor Code, Hazing, Mutual Respect, Alcohol Policy, etc.) will result in disciplinary action.\n*   **Severity:** Sanctions vary depending on the nature and severity of the offense, the cadet's disciplinary history, and the impact of the violation on the community.\n*   **Potential Sanctions:** Can include, but are not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, loss of privileges, probation, suspension, and expulsion from the Corps or university.\n\n### 6. Acknowledgment of Understanding\n*   **Requirement:** All cadets are required to formally acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agree to abide by all Corps and university policies and regulations.\n*   **Implication:** This acknowledgment signifies personal responsibility for adhering to the rules and understanding the consequences of non-compliance.\n\n### 7. Withdrawal Policy\n*   **Purpose:** Outlines the specific procedures, deadlines, and potential implications for cadets wishing to withdraw from the Corps or the university.\n*   **Specific Categories:\n    *   **First-Semester Cadets:** Specific guidelines and deadlines may apply for withdrawal during their initial semester, often with different financial or academic implications.\n    *   **Upper-Class Cadets:** Procedures for withdrawal for second, third, and fourth-year cadets, which may involve different administrative processes, financial obligations, or academic considerations.\n    *   **Second-Semester First-Year Cadets:** Distinct policies may exist for cadets withdrawing in their second semester of their first year, potentially bridging initial entry rules with those for more established cadets.",
