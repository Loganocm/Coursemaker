Based on the notes for Introduction to the Book, generate 20 flashcards. Each flashcard must be a JSON object with a 'front' (the question) and a 'back' (the answer). Focus on fundamental terms and concepts. Return a valid JSON array of these objects. Example format: [{ "front": "What is [term]?", "back": "[Explanation]" }, ...].

Please provide me with the content from the Introduction to the Book (1942 Oxford University Press edition) you'd like me to summarize.  I need that text to create the notes.
