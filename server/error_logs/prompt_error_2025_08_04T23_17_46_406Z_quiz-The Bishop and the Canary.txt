**The Bishop and the Canary: Key Concepts**

* **Small's Deep Affection for Her Canary:**
    * **Unconditional Love:** Small's love for her canary transcends the typical owner-pet relationship.  It's characterized by deep affection, concern for its well-being, and a profound sense of connection.  This is evident in her immediate distress at the bird's illness and her willingness to go to extreme lengths to save it.
    * **Anthropomorphism:** Small projects human emotions and characteristics onto her canary, demonstrating a level of anthropomorphism. This emotional investment intensifies her attachment.
    * **Source of Comfort:** The canary serves as a source of comfort and companionship for Small, highlighting the emotional support pets can provide.

* **The Encounter with the Bishop:**
    * **Clash of Values:** The Bishop represents a contrasting worldview to Small's.  His focus on religious dogma and societal expectations clashes directly with Small's prioritization of her emotional connection with her pet.  This conflict creates central tension in the story.
    * **Symbolism of the Canary:** The canary becomes a powerful symbol representing the inherent value of individual emotions and attachments, even those deemed insignificant by societal norms (represented by the Bishop).  Its illness and Small's desperation to save it highlight the importance of compassion and empathy.
    * **Irony and Satire:** The story uses irony and satire to critique societal expectations and the rigid adherence to religious dogma that may suppress individual emotions and personal connections. The Bishop’s seemingly uncaring response to Small’s distress is a satirical commentary on religious hypocrisy.
    * **Resolution (or lack thereof):** The story doesn't provide a clear resolution to the conflict. The ambiguity leaves the reader to consider the ongoing tension between personal emotional needs and societal pressures. This open ending encourages critical reflection on the themes presented.

* **Overall Themes:**
    * **The Importance of Compassion and Empathy:** The story underscores the need for compassion and empathy in our interactions with others and the living world.  Small's deep concern for her canary contrasts sharply with the Bishop's perceived lack of empathy.
    * **Challenging Social Norms:** The story subtly challenges the rigid social norms and expectations that may stifle individuality and emotional expression.
    * **The Value of Unconventional Connections:** The deep bond between Small and her canary highlights the value of non-traditional relationships and the significance of emotional connections.
    * **Conflict Between Individuality and Societal Expectations:**  The central conflict between Small's concern for her pet and the Bishop’s indifference reveals the ongoing tension between personal needs and the pressures of society.
