        "summary": "Purposes of Drawing\nA drawing can function in three ways:\nas a notation, sketch, or record of something seen, remembered, or\nimagined\nas a study or preparation for another, usually larger and more complex\nwork\nas an end in itself, a complete work of art\nWe see examples of the first case in Henry Moore's Study for Tube Shelter\nPerspective, which began this chapter, and in the Vincent van Gogh drawings\njust examined. The second case, drawing as preparatory tool, is traditional in\nWestern art. For example, Michelangelo made detailed studies of a Reclining\nMale Nude (fig. 6.10) for his finished painting of the figure on the ceiling of\nthe Sistine Chapel (see fig. 17.9).\n\n6.10 Michelangelo Buonarroti.\nStudy of a Reclining Male Nude.\nc.1511. Red chalk over stylus\nunderdrawing.7⅝′′×10¼′′\nThe British Museum © The Trustees of the British Museum.\nMichelangelo's studies are a record of exploration and discovery as he\n\ncarefully drew what he observed. His knowledge of anatomy helped him to\ndefine each muscle. The flow between the head, shoulders, and arms of the\nfigure is based on Michelangelo's feeling for visual continuity as well as his\nattention to detail. The parts of the figure that he felt needed further study he\ndrew repeatedly, as we see in the hands. To achieve the dark reds,\nMichelangelo evidently licked the point of the chalk.\nA simple, tiny sketch, quickly done, is often the starting point for a far larger\nand more complex work. In such drawings an artist can work out problems of\noverall design or concentrate on small details. For example, Picasso did many\nstudies in preparation for his major painting Guernica (figs. 6.11)– 6.13), a\nhuge work measuring more than 11 by 25 feet. Forty-five of Picasso's studies\nare preserved and dated; they show the evolution of this important work.\n6.11 Pablo Picasso. First\n\nComposition Study for\nGuernica. May 1, 1937. Pencil\non blue paper. 8¼′′×10⅝′′\nMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, Spain. ©\n2018 Estate of Pablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New\nYork.\n6.12 Pablo Picasso.\nComposition study for\nGuernica.

Guernica.\n1937. Oil on canvas.\n11′6′′×25′8′′\nMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, Spain. Art\nResource/Scala, Florence/John Bigelow Taylor. © 2018 Estate of\nPablo Picasso/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.\nThe first drawing for Guernica shows a dark form at the top center; this later\nbecame a woman with a lamp, apparently an important symbol to Picasso.\nThe woman leans out of a house in the upper right. On the left appears a bull\nwith a bird on its back. Both the bull and the woman with the lamp are major\nelements in the final painting. The first drawing was probably completed in a\nfew seconds, yet its quick, gestural lines contain the essence of the large,\ncomplex painting.\nAlthough artists do not generally consider their preliminary sketches as\nfinished pieces, studies by leading artists are often treasured both for their\nintrinsic beauty and for what they reveal about the creative process. Picasso\nrecognized the importance of documenting this process from initial idea to\n\nfinished painting:\nIt would be very interesting to preserve photographically, not the stages,\nbut the metamorphoses of a picture. Possibly one might then discover\nthe path followed by the brain in materializing a dream. But there is one\nvery odd thing to notice, that basically a picture doesn't change, that the\nfirst "vision" remains almost intact, in spite of appearances.11\nAnother type of preparatory drawing is the cartoon. The original meaning of\ncartoon, still used by art professionals, is a full-sized drawing made as a\nguide for a large work in another medium, particularly a mural, mosaic, or\ntapestry. In making the final work, artists often use such cartoons as overlays\nfor tracing.\nIn today's common usage, the word cartoon also refers to a narrative drawing\nemphasizing humorous or satirical content. Cartoons and comics are among\nthe most widely enjoyed drawings, and will be discussed later in this chapter.\nMany artists today view drawing as a medium in itself, and drawings as\nfinished works of art. Among these are several in this chapter, such as the\nworks by William Kentridge (see fig. 6.25) and Julie Mehretu (see fig. 6.30).\n\nTools and Techniques\nEach drawing tool and each type of paper has its own characteristics that\ninfluence the nature of the resulting drawing. The illustration Drawing Tools\nand Their Characteristic Lines (fig. 6.14) shows the different qualities of\nmarks made by common drawing tools. Some of these tools give a dry,\nrefined line; others are wet and more expressive. Note also how each tool\nresponds to varying degrees of pressure; the ink brush in the middle is most\nresponsive, the pen at the bottom, the least.\n6.14 Drawing Tools and Their\nCharacteristic Lines.\nArtists often draw rows of parallel lines to suggest shadows or volumes.\nThese lines are called hatching; each method is illustrated in the\naccompanying diagram, Types of Hatching (fig. 6.15).\n\n6.15a Types of Hatching.\nHatching.\n6.15b Types of Hatching.\nCross-hatching.\n\n6.15c Types of Hatching.\nContour hatching.\nThe sixteenth-century Italian painter Bartolomeo Passarotti used all three of\nthese methods in his sheet of studies (fig. 6.16). He used simple hatching in\nthe small standing figure at the upper right. To render the look of a bulging,\nmuscular arm, he used both contour hatching on the upper side and cross-
hatching in the darker areas below. Printmakers often use all three types of\nhatching as well to suggest mass and shadow (see Chapter 8).\n6.16 Bartolomeo Passarotti.\nStudies of a Left Arm, a Young\n\nWoman, etc. Undated 16th\ncentury. Pen and iron gall ink\non laid paper. 7⅞′′×11⅜′′\nNational Gallery of Art. 2000.124.1.a.\nThe quality and type of paper that an artist uses also have an important\nimpact on the drawing. Most drawing surfaces are smooth, but some papers\nhave tooth, a quality of roughness or surface grain that gives texture to a\ndrawing. Georges Seurat worked on very toothy paper to draw the child's\nface and cupped hand in L'écho (fig. 6.17); this detail from the larger work\n(fig. 6.20) shows the weave of the paper fibers.\n\n6.17 Georges Pierre Seurat.\nL'écho (detail). 1883–84. Black\nConté crayon on Michallet\npaper.\nDry Media\nDry drawing media include pencil, charcoal, Conté crayon, and pastel. Most\ndrawing pencils are made of graphite (a crystalline form of carbon). They are\navailable in varying degrees of hardness; softer pencils give darker lines, and\nharder pencils give lighter ones.\nDarkness and line quality are determined both by the degree of hardness of\nthe pencil and by the texture of the drawing surface. Pencil lines can vary in\nwidth or length, can be made by using the side of the pencil point in broad\nstrokes, and can be repeated as hatching. Artists create a considerable range\nof values by varying the pressure on a medium–soft drawing pencil.\nUmberto Boccioni used a variety of tools and techniques to create his\ndrawing States of Mind: The Farewells (fig. 6.18). We see sharp lines,\nstrokes made with the side of the charcoal, parallel hatched lines, and shaded\nareas.\n\n6.18 Umberto Boccioni. States\nof Mind: The Farewells. 1911
