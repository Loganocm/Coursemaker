  "notes": "## Introduction to the Corps\n\nThis chapter provides an essential overview of the Corps, detailing its unique structure, purpose, and expectations for cadets.\n\n### Program Overview\n*   **Senior Military College (SMC) Status:** The Corps operates within the framework of a Senior Military College, a distinct educational institution category in the United States. This designation implies a comprehensive military-style environment integrated with academic pursuits.\n    *   **Key Characteristic:** At an SMC, participation in the Corps program is typically mandatory for designated students, leading to a full immersion experience in a military lifestyle alongside their academic studies.\n*   **Distinction from ROTC:** While ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) programs exist at many universities, the Corps at an SMC differs significantly:\n    *   **Full Immersion:** Cadets live, study, and train within a military-style environment daily, often residing in barracks and adhering to a structured schedule.\n    *   **Mandatory Participation:** For Corps members, military training and discipline are integral to their educational experience, not an optional extracurricular.\n    *   **Institutional Identity:** The Corps defines a significant part of the institution's identity and culture, going beyond being just a program offered by a university.\n\n### Cadet Tracks\nCadets generally pursue one of two distinct tracks, aligning with their post-graduation aspirations:\n*   **Military-Leader Track:**\n    *   **Purpose:** This track is designed for cadets who aspire to commission as officers into the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force) upon graduation.\n    *   **Outcome:** Cadets on this track typically fulfill requirements for military service alongside their academic degrees, preparing them for leadership roles in the uniformed services.\n*   **Citizen-Leader Track:**\n    *   **Purpose:** This track is for cadets who seek to develop exceptional leadership, discipline, and character skills without the intention of commissioning into the military.\n    *   **Outcome:** Graduates are prepared for leadership roles in various civilian sectors, including business, government, non-profit organizations, and public service, leveraging the discipline and values learned in the Corps.\n\n### Corps Organization\nUnderstanding the Corps' organizational structure is crucial for cadets and their families.\n*   **Commandant's Office:** The Commandant leads the Corps, overseeing all aspects of cadet life, training, and discipline.\n*   **Deputy Commandants:** These officers serve as vital links in the chain of command and are often the primary points of contact for cadets and their families.\n    *   **Role:** Deputy Commandants are responsible for specific battalions, companies, or areas of cadet life, providing direct supervision, mentorship, and support.\n    *   **Primary Contact:** They are the first line of support and information for issues related to cadet performance, conduct, wellness, and day-to-day operations.\n*   **Commandant's Staff:** This team supports the Commandant in strategic planning, program development, administrative functions, and ensuring the overall well-being and success of the Corps.\n\n### Key Resources\n*   **Purpose of the Family Guide:** The Family Guide is an indispensable resource designed to assist and inform the families of cadets.\n    *   **Content:** It typically includes information on Corps policies, schedules, important dates, points of contact, cadet life, traditions, and advice for families to best support their cadet.\n    *   **Goal:** To foster a supportive environment for cadets by keeping their families informed and engaged.\n\n### Expectations for Cadets\nCadets are held to high standards across all facets of their experience within the Corps.\n*   **Performance:** This encompasses a cadet's achievement in various areas:\n    *   **Academic Excellence:** Maintaining required GPA and successfully completing coursework.\n    *   **Physical Fitness:** Meeting and exceeding physical training standards.\n    *   **Leadership Development:** Actively participating in leadership roles, demonstrating initiative, and developing command presence and decision-making skills.\n*   **Conduct:** This refers to a cadet's behavior and adherence to the Corps' values and regulations:\n    *   **Discipline:** Upholding strict adherence to rules, regulations, and the Corps' code of conduct.\n    *   **Upholding Values:** Demonstrating integrity, respect, honor, duty, and other core values of the institution and military profession (where applicable).\n    *   **Professionalism:** Maintaining a high standard of personal and professional conduct at all times, both on and off campus."
