Purposes of Drawing
A drawing can function in three ways:
as a notation, sketch, or record of something seen, remembered, or
imagined
as a study or preparation for another, usually larger and more complex
work
as an end in itself, a complete work of art
We see examples of the first case in Henry Moore’s Study for Tube Shelter
Perspective, which began this chapter, and in the Vincent van Gogh drawings
just examined. The second case, drawing as preparatory tool, is traditional in
Western art. For example, Michelangelo made detailed studies of a Reclining
Male Nude (fig. 6.10) for his finished painting of the figure on the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel (see fig. 17.9).

Michelangelo’s studies are a record of exploration and discovery as he

carefully drew what he observed. His knowledge of anatomy helped him to
define each muscle. The flow between the head, shoulders, and arms of the
figure is based on Michelangelo’s feeling for visual continuity as well as his
attention to detail. The parts of the figure that he felt needed further study he
drew repeatedly, as we see in the hands. To achieve the dark reds,
Michelangelo evidently licked the point of the chalk.
A simple, tiny sketch, quickly done, is often the starting point for a far larger
and more complex work. In such drawings an artist can work out problems of
overall design or concentrate on small details. For example, Picasso did many
studies in preparation for his major painting Guernica (figs. 6.11)– 6.13), a
huge work measuring more than 11 by 25 feet. Forty-five of Picasso’s studies
are preserved and dated; they show the evolution of this important work.

The first drawing for Guernica shows a dark form at the top center; this later
became a woman with a lamp, apparently an important symbol to Picasso.
The woman leans out of a house in the upper right. On the left appears a bull
with a bird on its back. Both the bull and the woman with the lamp are major
elements in the final painting. The first drawing was probably completed in a
few seconds, yet its quick, gestural lines contain the essence of the large,
complex painting.
Although artists do not generally consider their preliminary sketches as
finished pieces, studies by leading artists are often treasured both for their
intrinsic beauty and for what they reveal about the creative process. Picasso
recognized the importance of documenting this process from initial idea to

finished painting:
It would be very interesting to preserve photographically, not the stages,
but the metamorphoses of a picture. Possibly one might then discover
the path followed by the brain in materializing a dream. But there is one
very odd thing to notice, that basically a picture doesn’t change, that the
first “vision” remains almost intact, in spite of appearances.11
Another type of preparatory drawing is the cartoon. The original meaning of
cartoon, still used by art professionals, is a full-sized drawing made as a
guide for a large work in another medium, particularly a mural, mosaic, or
tapestry. In making the final work, artists often use such cartoons as overlays
for tracing.
In today’s common usage, the word cartoon also refers to a narrative drawing
emphasizing humorous or satirical content. Cartoons and comics are among
the most widely enjoyed drawings, and will be discussed later in this chapter.
Many artists today view drawing as a medium in itself, and drawings as
finished works of art. Among these are several in this chapter, such as the
works by William Kentridge (see fig. 6.25) and Julie Mehretu (see fig. 6.30).

Tools and Techniques
Each drawing tool and each type of paper has its own characteristics that
influence the nature of the resulting drawing. The illustration Drawing Tools
and Their Characteristic Lines (fig. 6.14) shows the different qualities of
marks made by common drawing tools. Some of these tools give a dry,
refined line; others are wet and more expressive. Note also how each tool
responds to varying degrees of pressure; the ink brush in the middle is most
responsive, the pen at the bottom, the least.
6.14 Drawing Tools and Their
Characteristic Lines.
Artists often draw rows of parallel lines to suggest shadows or volumes.
These lines are called hatching; each method is illustrated in the
accompanying diagram, Types of Hatching (fig. 6.15).

6.15a Types of Hatching.

6.15b Types of Hatching.
Cross-hatching.

6.15c Types of Hatching.
Contour hatching.
The sixteenth-century Italian painter Bartolomeo Passarotti used all three of
these methods in his sheet of studies (fig. 6.16). He used simple hatching in
the small standing figure at the upper right. To render the look of a bulging,
muscular arm, he used both contour hatching on the upper side and cross-
hatching in the darker areas below. Printmakers often use all three types of
hatching as well to suggest mass and shadow (see Chapter 8).

The quality and type of paper that an artist uses also have an important
impact on the drawing. Most drawing surfaces are smooth, but some papers
have tooth, a quality of roughness or surface grain that gives texture to a
drawing. Georges Seurat worked on very toothy paper to draw the child’s
face and cupped hand in L’écho (fig. 6.17); this detail from the larger work
(fig. 6.20) shows the weave of the paper fibers.

Dry Media
Dry drawing media include pencil, charcoal, Conté crayon, and pastel. Most
drawing pencils are made of graphite (a crystalline form of carbon). They are
available in varying degrees of hardness; softer pencils give darker lines, and
harder pencils give lighter ones.
Darkness and line quality are determined both by the degree of hardness of
the pencil and by the texture of the drawing surface. Pencil lines can vary in
width or length, can be made by using the side of the pencil point in broad
strokes, and can be repeated as hatching. Artists create a considerable range
of values by varying the pressure on a medium–soft drawing pencil.
Umberto Boccioni used a variety of tools and techniques to create his
drawing States of Mind: The Farewells (fig. 6.18). We see sharp lines,
strokes made with the side of the charcoal, parallel hatched lines, and shaded
areas.

The sticks of charcoal used today are similar to those used by prehistoric
peoples to draw on cave walls: Both are simply charred sticks of wood. With
charcoal, dark areas can be drawn quickly. Charcoal produces a wide range of
light to dark values, from soft grays to deep velvety blacks. The various hard-
to-soft grades of charcoal provide a versatile medium for both beginning and

advanced artists. Because not all charcoal particles bind to the surface of the
paper, charcoal is easy to smudge, blur, or erase. This quality is both an
advantage and a drawback: it enables quick changes, but finished works can
easily smear. A completed charcoal drawing may be set or “fixed” with a thin
varnish called a fixative, which is sprayed over it to help seal the charcoal
onto the paper and prevent smudging.
We see many shades of gray in the remarkable drawing Web #5 by Vija
Celmins (fig. 6.19). The web emerges from darkness at the upper left, as the
artist carefully shaded each concentric circle. She made only black marks,
letting

the paper show through for the white portions. She even captured the web’s
flaws and incomplete parts.
Conté crayon is made from graphite that is mixed with clay and pressed into
sticks. It can produce varied lines or broad strokes that resist smudging far
more than charcoal. Wax-based crayons, such as those that children use, are
avoided by serious artists; they lack flexibility, and most fade over time.
Because the strokes of color do not blend easily, it is difficult to obtain bright
color mixtures with wax crayons.
Georges Seurat used Conté crayon to build up the illusion of three-
dimensional form through value gradations (chiaroscuro) in his drawing
L’écho (fig. 6.20). Seurat actually drew a multitude of lines, yet in the final
drawing the individual lines are obscured by the total effect of finely textured
light and dark areas. He selected Conté crayon on rough paper as a means of
concentrating on basic forms and on the interplay of light and shadow.

Natural chalks of red, white, and black have been used for drawing since
ancient times. Pastels, produced since the seventeenth century, have
characteristics similar to those of natural chalk. They have a freshness and
purity of color because they are composed mostly of pigment, with very little
binding material. Because no drying is needed, there is no change in color, as
occurs in some paints as they dry. Soft pastels do not allow for much detail;
they force the user to work boldly. Blending of strokes with fingers or a paper
stump made for the purpose produces a soft blur that lightly mixes the colors.
Pastels yield the most exciting results when not overworked.
Venetian portraitist Rosalba Carriera made dozens of works with pastels in
the early eighteenth century. Her Portrait of a Girl with a Bussola (fig. 6.21)
shows her sensitivity to the medium. The hard, fine-grained pastels in
common use at that time give the finished work a smooth surface that makes
possible fine color shadings. Because of the artist’s light, deft touch with
short strokes of the pastel, the work resembles an oil painting in its
appearance, an effect promoted by the very smooth paper.

French artist Edgar Degas shifted his attention from oil painting to pastels in
his later years, and occasionally he combined the two in a single work. He
took advantage of the rich colors and subtle blends possible with pastel.
Although carefully constructed, his compositions look like casual, fleeting
glimpses of everyday life. In Le Petit D ́jeuner apr`s le bain (Breakfast after
the Bath) (fig. 6.22), bold contours give a sense of movement to the whole
design. He drew the work in pastels coarser than the fine-grained ones that
Carriera used; we can see the difference by comparing the level of detail in
each work.

Liquid Media
Black and brown inks are the most common drawing liquids. Some brush
drawings are made with washes of ink thinned with water. Such ink drawings
are similar to watercolor paintings. Felt- and fiber-tipped marker pens are
widely used recent additions to the traditional pen-and-ink media.
Nineteenth-century Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, a skilled and prolific
draftsman, is said to have created about 13,000 prints and drawings during
his lifetime. In Tuning the Samisen (fig. 6.23), the expressive elegance of his
lines was made possible by his control of the responsive brush. In Asia, the
same brushes are used for traditional writing and for drawing. These brushes
are ideal for making calligraphic lines because they hold a substantial amount
of ink and readily produce lines thick and thin under varying pressure.
Hokusai played the uniformly thin lines of head, hands, and instrument
against the bold, spontaneous strokes indicating the folds of the kimono. We
can follow some of his longer brushstrokes with our eyes, watching as the
line grows thicker or thinner.

In Eliezer and Rebecca at the Well (fig. 6.24), the seventeenth-century artist
Rembrandt van Rijn used liquid media to sketch quickly a compositional
arrangement for a possible painting. Pens of varying widths yield ink strokes
that show his speed of execution. He used parallel hatching lines for darker
areas, and further darkened several of these regions with brown wash,
especially in the right half of the page. In a few places—near the foot of the
cliff, at Eliezer’s knee, and near the top of the mountain at the right—he
lightened his previous shadings by applying white gouache, a type of opaque
watercolor. This drawing shows Rembrandt at his most spontaneous; he
probably had little idea that we would be studying it centuries later. The
inscriptions along the lower edge come from a later owner.

Some artists today create drawings and offer them as finished works because
they value the immediacy and spontaneity of drawing. One of these is the
South African William Kentridge. He created Drawing for “Lulu” (fig. 6.25)
using both wet and dry media over pages of an obsolete dictionary. He told
an interviewer that he enjoys working on such paper because it represents
faded authority. This work is a portrait of the composer Alban Berg, whom
the artist admired. The quick execution of the drawing finds a parallel in the
casually slapped-together pages. He has also created drawings for animation,
in which each drawing is photographed individually and projected in rapid
succession, similar to movie frames.

Comics and Graphic Novels
A comic is a sequential artform based on drawing. Printed comics represent
the culmination of a development that includes some ancient Egyptian
murals, medieval
tapestries, and some print series created in the 1730s. They have been a
popular feature in newspapers for more than 100 years. One of the most
imaginative of the early newspaper comics was Little Nemo in Slumberland
(fig. 6.26), which narrated and illustrated a child’s fantastic dreams. In the
example shown here—the last line of a full-page comic—a tuba player loses
control of his instrument as it lengthens with every note that he plays.

Nemo in Slumberland (detail).
In recent years, comics have become a much more serious artform, as their
creators take up unusual or important subjects. In the 1980s, Los Angeles-

based Gilbert Hernandez teamed with his brothers Jaime and Mario to create
Love and Rockets, one of the longest-running comics. This series dealt with
gang life, love and romance, and social issues that the Southern California
Mexican-American community faced. When the series came to an end in
1996, Gilbert began drawing highly imaginative short stories that were
collected into the volume Fear of Comics (fig. 6.27) in 2000. These stories
show a wide range of characters and themes (not all of them publishable in a
text such as this). In one story, for example, Gilbert takes Herman Melville’s
classic novel Moby-Dick and boils it down to six crisply drawn frames.

More ambitious are graphic novels, which resemble comic books but have
book-length story lines. The increasing acceptance of this type of novel has
led major publishers to seek out artists and produce their work for national
distribution. One of the most successful such artists in recent years is the
Canadian-born Emily Carroll. Her graphic novels and stories update ancient
horror tales by locating them in contemporary situations. She also works
frequently on the Internet, where she posts webcomics for all to see. For
example, she created her recent story All Along the Wall (fig. 6.28) by
scanning pen drawings and loading them into Photoshop for alteration and
finishing. This story is about a girl who finds herself bored at a family
holiday party, so she asks to hear a horror story. We access this work by
clicking and scrolling instead of turning pages.

Graphic novelist Richard McGuire goes further into interactivity with his
hand-drawn stories. His 2015 graphic novel Here was first published on
paper in 1989 (fig. 6.29). It tells the story of one person’s life as it progresses
in a single house at various moments in time. In the interactive version,
which is accessible on either a computer or a tablet screen, the various dates
in each frame become “hot spots” for viewers to click on. They decide for
themselves how to unfold the story. Different events at widely different times
can share the same screen. This graphic novel reaches back into the ancient
past and forward to the future, bending our sense of time.

Contemporary Approaches
Today’s artists have considerably expanded the definitions and uses of
drawing. Many use it in combination with other media in finished works.
Some artists create works in new ways using new media, and label them
drawings because no other name quite describes what they do. Julie Mehretu,
for example, uses media from both drawing and painting in the same large
works. Her Back to Gondwanaland (fig. 6.30) includes colored swatches of
cut paper along with drawn ink lines. She makes abstract drawings, but the
shapes she uses generally suggest the impersonal public spaces of today’s
mass-produced world: offices, classrooms, airports, and stadiums. If drawing
has been traditionally an organic process, her works do not look entirely
handmade.

Rather, they exist in a gap between the natural and the manufactured, and
between drawing and painting.
Christine Hiebert makes lines directly on walls with the blue tape that
painters use to mask negative spaces. In works that she creates specifically
for each exhibition, her lines affect our perception of the space. In her work
Reconnaissance (fig. 6.31), for example, she interrupted the clean horizontals
and verticals of a gallery with diagonals of varying thickness. Her lines
resemble drawn lines, but in fact she has “drawn” the tape across the walls.
When the show is over, the tape comes off without leaving a trace.

The drawings of Ingrid Calame begin as rubbings taken from highly textured
surfaces. For #334 Drawing, Babel in Wonderland (fig. 6.32), she visited an
abandoned steel plant in upstate New York, and the cement-lined pathway of
the Los Angeles River. She selects and combines rubbings by overlaying
them, and then she laboriously copies each layer with colored pencil. Each
color in a final drawing comes from a different initial rubbing. These
drawings render the most minute details of the floor beneath us, exactly and
painstakingly, in images of eerie beauty.

An increasing (but still small) number of artists have begun to routinely
employ digital screen-based drawing techniques and to create works with
them. Carla Gannis, for example, makes self-portraits by taking selfies and
then altering them using these new media. The Selfie Drawings is a series of
52 works that she created over the course of one year in 2015. She put her
photographic self-portrait through all sorts of manipulations, adding text or
drawing, adding layers or color, or cropping and duplicating. Many of these
drawings refer to earlier works in the history of art. Number 41 in the series
(fig. 6.33) shows her own body poking out of a Tower of Babel, which is
based on a famous 1563 work with that title. Gannis created some of the
clouds that roll by with the clone stamp tool in Photoshop. We see the artist
herself doing financial calculations on a screen with a stylus. The numbers
are backward, as if she were writing on the other side of the transparent
screen. Artists throughout history have made self-portraits as vehicles for
self-examination; Gannis sees herself in the latest media, filtering her identity
through historic images.

At the time of writing, Google was introducing a digital system called Tilt
Brush that enables drawing in three dimensions. By donning a virtual-reality
headset and holding the proper tools, users can select colors and stroke styles
from a digital palette in one hand and then draw in space with the other.
Results are visible only through the headset, but the work can be saved for
later use or for enjoyment by another viewer. We can only speculate about
the possible uses for this technology.

As we have seen in the examples in this chapter, drawing is an immediate
way to communicate through imagery. It enables artists to share their ideas,
feelings, experiences, and imaginings with us whether in a sketch, a
preparatory study, or a finished work.

Watercolor
Artists have used water-based paint media for thousands of years. Paints very
similar to modern watercolor appear in paintings from ancient Egypt, and
also in ancient Chinese manuscripts.
In watercolor, pigments are mixed with water as a vehicle and gum arabic
(sap from the acacia tree) as a binder. The most common support today is
white rag paper (made from cotton rag), because of its superior absorbency
and longevity. Such paper usually requires no priming; the paper itself is both
the ground and the support. Watercolor was traditionally sold in solid blocks
that the painter mixed with water to reach the desired thickness; today most
professional watercolor is sold in tubes.
Watercolor is basically a staining technique. The paint is applied in thin,
translucent washes that allow light to pass through the layers of color and to
reflect back from the white paper. Highlights are obtained by leaving areas of
white paper unpainted. Opaque (nontranslucent) watercolor is sometimes
added for detail. Watercolors are well suited to spontaneous as well as
carefully planned applications. Despite the simple materials involved,
watercolor is a demanding medium because the absorbency of the paper
support does not permit easy changes or corrections. Moreover, if you
overwork a watercolor, you lose its characteristic freshness.
Watercolor’s fluid spontaneity makes it a favorite medium for painters who
want to catch quick impressions outdoors. The translucent quality of
watercolor washes particularly suits depictions of water, atmosphere, light,
and weather.
Nineteenth-century American artist Winslow Homer was among the most
devoted to watercolor. His 1873 work Boys Wading (fig. 7.2) shows many of
watercolor’s properties. Both the boys and the water seem quickly sketched;
the background shapes are flatter, which reflects how things farther away
appear to our eyes under bright light. The water and the foreground shoreline
are quickly brushed, with mostly horizontal strokes. In order to capture the

dappled surface of the water, Homer used strokes of analogous colors. The
brightness of the boys’ shirts in the sunshine was easy to achieve with this
transparent medium.

Homer created the highlights on the water after the first layer had dried by
applying opaque watercolor, also known as gouache. We see these strokes
most clearly at the left near the shoreline. Gouache is watercolor with small
amounts of white chalk powder added for opacity. It was common in book
illustration during the European Middle Ages, and also in traditional Persian
art. It is popular in our times with designers and illustrators because of its
ease of use and low cost.
In traditional Chinese watercolor technique, the artist employs water-based
black ink as well as color, and often uses the ink without color. The Chinese
regard painting as descended from the art of calligraphy, which is also done
with black ink. In Asia, black ink painting is a fully developed artform,
accorded at least as much honor as painting with color.
A good example of a traditional Chinese painting that uses both ink and
watercolor is Five Deer Hermitage by Li Shida (fig. 7.3). The artist used ink
for the black areas such as roof lines, with watercolor in the green and bluish
areas. He also used many different types of brushstroke, most of them small
in scale, which he learned by making calligraphy; we see this most clearly in
the foliage.

Fresco
In true fresco, pigments suspended in water are applied to a damp lime-
plaster surface. The vehicle is water, and the binder is the lime present in the
damp plaster. The earliest true fresco paintings date from about 1800 BCE at
a site in today’s southwestern Turkey. The technique was also practiced in
some cultures of pre-Columbian Mexico.
In Renaissance Italy, fresco was the favored medium for painting on church
walls. Probably the best-known fresco paintings are those by Michelangelo
on the Sistine Chapel ceiling in the Vatican (see fig. 17.9). His contemporary
Raphael also created frescoes. We see a close-up of his technique in Assumed
Portrait of Francesco Maria della Rovere (fig. 7.4). This is a detail of the
much larger work The School of Athens (see fig. 3.22).

Most fresco painters first prepare a full-size drawing in the form of a cartoon,
then transfer the design to the freshly laid plaster wall before painting.
Because the plaster dries quickly, only the portion of the wall that can be
painted in one day is prepared; joints between each day’s work are usually
arranged along the edges of major shapes in the composition.
The painter works quickly in a rapid staining process similar to watercolor.
Lime, in contact with air, forms transparent calcium crystals that chemically
bind the pigment to the moist lime-plaster wall. The lime in the plaster thus
becomes the binder, creating a smooth, extremely durable surface. Once the
surface has dried, the painting is part of the wall, rather than resting on its
surface. Because lime-plaster walls are subject to mold infestations, fresco is
most suitable to drier climatic zones.
The artist must have the design completely worked out before painting,
because no changes can be made after the paint is applied to the fresh plaster.
Fresco technique does not permit the delicate manipulation of transitional
tones; but the luminosity, fine surface, and permanent color make it an ideal
medium for large murals. (A mural is any wall-size painting; fresco is one
possible medium for such a work.)
Fresco secco (dry fresco), another ancient wall-painting method, is done on
finished, dried lime-plaster walls. With this technique, tempera paint is
applied to a clean, dry surface or over an already dried true fresco to achieve
greater color intensity than is possible with true fresco alone. Fresco painters

often retouch their work, or put on finishing details, in fresco secco over the
true fresco.
After the Renaissance and Baroque periods, fresco became less popular,
being eclipsed by the more flexible oil medium. However, a revival of the
fresco technique began in Mexico in the 1920s, encouraged by the new
revolutionary government’s support for the arts. A fresco mural is often a
piece of public art that cannot be bought or sold; such a mural in a public
place is available to all classes of people equally. This characteristic
motivated the Mexican government in the 1920s to pay painters at union
wages to decorate public buildings with murals, most of them in fresco.
Diego Rivera was a leader in this movement, which influenced art in the
United States. The Detroit Institute of Arts invited him to create Detroit
Industry (fig. 7.5) in true fresco in the lobby. The largest panel of this large
work depicts the manufacture of automobile engines. The panels above show
raw materials in the earth; those at the wings depict scientific advances.

Oil
In Western art, oil paint has been a favorite medium for five centuries.
Pigments mixed with various vegetable oils, such as linseed, walnut, and
poppyseed, were used in the Middle Ages for decorative purposes. But,
beginning in the fifteenth century, oil painting flourished when Flemish
painters perfected a recipe for paint made with a binder of linseed oil pressed
from the seeds of the flax plant, mixed with turpentine as a vehicle. In this
early period, artists applied oil paint to wood panels covered with smooth
layers of gesso, as in the older tradition of tempera painting.
The brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck were among the early leaders of
European oil painting. They achieved glowing, jewel-like surfaces that
remain amazingly fresh to the present day. Jan van Eyck’s Madonna and
Child with the Chancellor Rolin (fig. 7.9) is an example of his early mastery
of the oil technique. Jan painted it on a small gesso-covered wood panel.
After beginning with a brush drawing in tempera, he proceeded with thin
layers of oil paint, moving from light to dark and from opaque to translucent
colors. The luminous quality of the surface is the result of successive oil
glazes. A glaze is a very thin, transparent film of color applied over a
previously painted surface. To produce glazes, oil colors selected for their
transparency are diluted with a mixture of oil and varnish. Glazes give depth
to painted surfaces by allowing light to pass through and reflect from lower
paint layers.

In this painting, the sparkling jewels, the textiles, and the furs each show their
own refined textures. Within the context of the religious subject, the artist
demonstrated his enthusiasm for the delights of the visible world. Veils of
glazes in the sky area provide atmospheric perspective and thus contribute to
the illusion of deep space in the enticing view beyond the open window. The
evolution in the new oil painting technique made such realism possible.
Oil has many advantages over other traditional media. Compared to tempera,
oil paint can provide both increased opacity&#x02014;which yields better
covering power&#x02014;and, when thinned, greater transparency. Its slow
drying time is a distinct advantage, allowing artists to blend strokes of color
and make changes during the painting process. Pigment colors in oil change
little when drying; however, the binder (usually linseed oil) has a tendency to
darken and yellow slightly with age. Because layers of dried oil paint are
flexible, sixteenth-century Venetian painters who wished to paint large
pictures replaced heavy wood panels with canvas stretched on wood frames.
A painted canvas is not only light in weight but can also be unstretched and
rolled for transporting if the paint layer is not too thick. Most oil painters
today still prefer canvas supports.
Oil can be applied thickly or thinly, wet onto wet or wet onto dry. When
applied thickly, it is called impasto, a variation of the word paste (oil paint
works best for this technique). Artists use impasto when they feel that a
richly textured surface is appropriate for their message. When a work is
painted wet onto wet and completed at one sitting, the process is called the

direct painting method.
Tom Wudl used the direct method to create his small work Rembrandt ’s
Indulgence was Van Gogh’s Dilemma (fig. 7.10), shown here slightly larger
than actual size. He created this work to test the properties of oil paint, and
indeed it shows many traits of the medium. In this painting we see the texture
of the canvas at the edges, covered with a white ground. The artist built up
layers of impasto near the top of the work, showing the piled-up strokes that
oil-based paint makes possible. The paint must be relatively thick, like paste,
to create this effect. Below, curving strokes in shades of yellow swim around.
Here he thinned the paint by adding turpentine. At the center is a meticulous
depiction of a metal pitcher similar to one that the artist saw in a painting by
Rembrandt. In that portion of the work, Wudl smoothed over his brushstrokes
to heighten the trompe l’oeil qualities. He titled the work after two historical
artists, Rembrandt and van Gogh, whose treatment of oil paint was
innovative. This tiny work, alongside Madonna and Child with the
Chancellor Rolin, shows us a wide range of the capabilities of the medium.

More recently, oil painters have broken out of the box of the rectangular
canvas. Elizabeth Murray was a leader in this, as she painted on irregular
shapes that she bolted together into whimsical and high-spirited creations
(see Elizabeth Murray: Paintings Let Out of the Zoo on p. 124). Bop (fig.
7.11) is an array of jagged and irregular surfaces that the artist titled after a
style of jazz music that she enjoyed listening to as she worked. She found the
subject matter in something from her daily life. She said, ′′When you walk
out of the studio, and you walk down the street, that's where you find art; you
find it in the street. Or you find it at home, right in front of you. I paint about
the things that surround me—things that I pick up and handle every day.
That’s what art is. Art is an epiphany in a coffee cup.1

“I never thought of myself as very talented,” Elizabeth Murray (1940–2012)
told an interviewer in 1991. “It’s just that I found something that I really
wanted to do.”2
Murray was born in Chicago and grew up wanting to be a commercial artist.
“All my ideas about art came from looking at comic books,” she said.3 She
enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago, but soon developed a somewhat
rebellious attitude: “I went to art school in Chicago and took your basic art
history courses and I was shocked at how boring it was. There wasn’t any
emotion or heart or a sense of where these things came from, why people did

these paintings.”4 Exposure to early modern art from the turn of the twentieth
century excited her interest enough that she continued her education in
California, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree at Mills College.
Many artists during the 1960s regarded New York as the most important
center of the art world, so Murray settled there after finishing her degree.
There she found a scene basically controlled by men who seemed to promote
one another. She crossed that hurdle by steady effort: “When I was young,
the question was, ‘How does a woman who wants to be an artist in the early
1960s find her voice when her teachers and heroes are men and all the art that
she admires is by men?’ I found the male-female thing tended to fall away the
more deeply I studied their works.”5
At that time many in the art world thought that painting as an art medium was
exhausted and that nearly everything meaningful had already been said or
done with paint. This also delayed recognition for Murray; her first solo
exhibition came in 1976, when she was aged 36.
Murray’s somewhat irreverent attitude was the key to her early success, as we
see in Falling, a work from that period (Figure 7.13.). The canvas is divided
into abstract shapes in which distinguishing positive from negative,
foreground from Murray’s somewhat irreverent attitude was the key to her
early success, as we see in Falling, a work from that period (fig. 7.13). The
canvas is divided into abstract shapes in which distinguishing positive from
negative, foreground from

The next step, which Murray took in the 1980s, involved shattering the
canvas surface and painting onto irregularly shaped parts, which she then
bolted together. In short, she bade farewell to the rectangle. Her working
method was to make drawings of the shapes on large sheets of paper, and
send them off to fabricators, who made wood silhouettes from them before
covering them with canvas for her to paint on. Such a work is Bop (see
Figure 7.11). This brash and exuberant work has many pieces, some of which
have holes in them. Some of the shapes resemble motifs from comics, such as
speech bubbles or explosions. Like many of Murray’s works, Bop lies
between abstract and representational art. It also lies between painting and
sculpture, an idea that very few other artists had at the time
Murray’s principal contribution was to break painting out of the molds that
people had put it into. Or, as she described it, “I want my paintings to be like
wild things that just burst out of the zoo.”6

Acrylic
Many artists today use acrylic paint, an invention of the mid-twentieth
century. The binder that holds the pigment is acrylic polymer, a synthetic
resin that provides a fast-drying, flexible film. The vehicle is water. Acrylics
adhere to a wider variety of surfaces than do traditional painting media.
Because the acrylic resin binder is transparent, colors can maintain a high
degree of intensity. Unlike oils, acrylics rarely darken or yellow with age.
Their rapid drying time restricts blending and limits reworking, but it greatly
reduces the time involved in layering processes such as glazing. Water
thinning is also more convenient in the studio than the volatile and toxic
turpentine of oil paint.
The paintings of Yunhee Min take advantage of the properties of the acrylic
medium. A recent work is Into the Sun #10 (fig. 7.14). Here she uses pure,
bright shades, which may or may not come from nature. She generally lays
large canvases down on a work table before applying the paint with a
squeegee rather than a brush. She works this way in order to remove traces of
the artist’s hand and make the color the first object of our attention. Acrylic
works well for laying down these flat areas, and its water-based translucency
allows the layers to blend, creating mixtures that are sometimes accidental or
arrived at during the process of creation. At 6 x 7 feet, the work nearly fills
the viewer’s eye, somewhat like looking into the sun.

Chapter 8 Printmaking
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. 8.1 Define the key printmaking terms and identify the main reasons
artists make prints.
2. 8.2 Summarize the characteristics and media of relief printing.
3. 8.3 Differentiate between the various processes of intaglio printing.
4. 8.4 Discuss the uses of lithography in printmaking and publishing.
5. 8.5 Explain the processes of stencil and screenprinting.
6. 8.6 Discuss the impact of new materials and technology on
contemporary printmaking.
The first thing we might notice about the print Quiver (fig. 8.1) is its layering
of images. A framed dragonfly hovers in a yellow-green square; a negative
picture of a radio telescope seems to overlay a closer view of a similar
device. Underneath all is a pattern of gray-green branches, silhouetted as if on
a forest floor. Note that each layer has its color: gray, blue, brown, black,
green. Overall, the work seems a meditation on fragile structures, which
might “quiver” in a strong wind.

This layering of images resembles in some ways the process of memory:
Each of our memories inhabits a layer of our minds, and each probably has its
“color” of feeling or association. Such are the goals of the creator of Quiver,
Tanja Softic, who said that she tries to make “visual poems.” It is no mistake
that she chose a print to realize this vision, because this type of layering is a
technique uniquely suited to printmaking.
Because of their lower prices and wider distribution, prints are among the
more accessible artforms. In this chapter we will define prints and consider
some of the purposes behind their creation. We will then discuss the various
traditional methods of printmaking: relief, intaglio, lithography, stencil. We
will conclude with a look at how some artists today are breaking out of old
boundaries and making prints in new ways.

Prints and Their Purposes
In the simplest terms, a print is an artwork that exists in multiple copies. A
print is thus one of a series of nearly identical pieces, usually printed on
paper. Prints are made from a matrix (the plural is matrices), which an artist
may create of metal, wood, or stone. The matrix carries ink, and artists create
prints by pressing or overlaying the matrix onto the print surface. Artists may
supervise the printing process or do it themselves; in either case, a group of
images from the same matrix is usually called an edition, and prints are often
referred to as editioned works, as opposed to unique works in other media
such as painting.
Nearly all prints are numbered to indicate the total quantity of prints pulled,
or printed, in the edition, and to give the number of each print in the
sequence. The figure 6/50 on a print, for example, generally indicates that it
was the sixth print pulled from an edition of 50. Artists usually both sign and
number prints created by them or under their supervision.
As part of the printmaking process, artists sometimes make prints called
progressive proofs at various stages to see how the image on the matrix is
developing. When a satisfactory stage is reached, the artist makes a few prints
for his or her record and personal use. These are marked AP, meaning artist’s
proof.
One of the best definitions of an original print comes from artist June Wayne:
“It is a work of art, usually on paper, which has siblings . . . They all look
alike, they were all made at the same time from the same matrix, the same
creative impulse, and they are all originals. The fact that there are many of
them is irrelevant.”1 Another artist described print editions this way: “Prints
mimic what we are as humans: we are all the same and yet every one is
different.”2
The technologies for both printing and papermaking came to Europe from
China. By the ninth century, the Chinese were printing pictures from
woodblock matrices; by the eleventh century, they had invented (but seldom
used) movable type. Printmaking was developed in Europe during the

fifteenth century—first in order to meet the demand for inexpensive religious
images and playing cards, then to illustrate books printed with the new
European movable type.
As recently as the late nineteenth century, printmakers were still needed to
copy drawings, paintings, and even early photographs by making plates to be
used, along with movable type, for illustrating newspapers and books.
However, as photomechanical methods of reproduction were developed in
the later nineteenth century, handwork played a decreasing role in the
printing process.
Generally, artists make prints for one or more of the following reasons:
They may wish to make multiple works that are less expensive than
paintings or sculpture, so that their work will be available for purchase
by a wider group of viewers.
They may wish to influence social causes. Because prints are multiple
works, they are easy to distribute far more widely than a unique work of
art.
They may be fascinated by the process of printmaking, which is an
absorbing craft in itself.
Relief
We already know what a relief print is, if we think of how fingerprints,
rubber stamps, and wet tires leave their marks. In a relief process the artist
creates the matrix by cutting away all parts of the printing surface not meant
to carry ink; this leaves the design “in relief” at the level of the original
surface (see the Relief diagram, fig. 8.2). Tools for such carving include
gouges of various widths, knives, and chisels. The surface is then inked, and
the ink is transferred to paper with pressure. The design carved into the
matrix is reversed on contact with the paper.

8.2 Relief.
Woodcut
The oldest relief prints are woodcuts (or woodblocks). The woodcut process
lends itself to designs with bold black-and-white contrast. The image-bearing
block of (usually soft) wood is a plank cut along the grain. Because the
woodcut medium does not easily yield shades of color, artists who use it are
generally drawn by the challenge of working in black and white only. Others
use woodcut because they enjoy the feel of carving a fresh block of wood.
Woodcut editions are limited to a couple of hundred because the relief edges
begin to deteriorate with repeated pressure.
Woodblock printing flourished in Japan in the seventeenth through the
nineteenth centuries. Japanese woodblock prints were made through a
complex process that included multiple blocks to achieve subtle and highly
integrated color effects. Because they were much cheaper than paintings,
these prints were the preferred artform for middle-class people who lived in
the capital city of Edo (now known as Tokyo). Their subject matter included
famous theater actors, nightlife, landscapes, and even erotic pictures.
Japanese prints were among the first objects of Asian art to find favor among
European artists, and many painters in the late nineteenth century were
strongly influenced by them (see Chapter21).
Color woodcuts, a Japanese specialty, are usually printed with multiple
woodblocks. As with most printmaking techniques, when more than one
color is used, individually inked blocks—one for each color—are carefully

lined up to ensure that colors will be exactly placed in the final print; this is
known as registration.
Utagawa Hiroshige’s print Shono Hakuu (Light Rain at Shono; fig. 8.3) is a
good example of Japanese printmaking at a high level. The print required
four blocks, one for each color. The atmospheric effects of the rain and the
distant forest are delicate and difficult to achieve, as the fine lines in this
work require both careful carving and precise registration. The work is one of
53 that Hiroshige created that depict various stops on the road from Edo to
Kyoto; it was his most popular series.

The detail in Hiroshige’s print is quite different from the roughness of the
woodcut Port Scene by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (fig. 8.4). This image may
even be indecipherable at first; it depicts a harbor with sailboats that cast
large, dark, triangular shadows downward. We sense the texture of the matrix
in this work, because the artist seems to have gouged or even hacked at the
wood to make the white areas. Because most of the strokes go vertically, the
grain of the wood block was probably also vertical. Kirchner’s direct and
expressive approach amounted to a revolt against the highly polished and
subtle effects that many other European printmakers were seeking in those
days.

Wood Engraving
A related method that was commonly used in the nineteenth century for book
illustration is wood engraving. In this method, the artist uses very dense
wood (often boxwood) set on end rather than sideways. The hardness of the
wood requires the use of metal engraving tools, but it also makes large
editions possible, facilitating the use of wood engraving in publishing.
English artist William Blake was one of the early pioneers of this medium.
He illustrated the book Thornton’s Pastorals of Virgil in 1821 with a series of
wood engravings. The book is a collection of ancient Roman poems extolling
the virtues of rural life; one of Blake’s illustrations is Boy Returning Joyfully,
with Plough and Oxen (fig. 8.5). Here we see some herders going home at
sunset; we also see the high detail that is possible through the use of
engraving tools. The artist’s fine white gouges go with nearly equal ease in
all directions, showing the lack of grain in dense wood that is stood upright
for carving. Blake made the brighter areas by carving deeper gouges.

Linocut
The linoleum cut (or linocut) is a modern development in relief printing. The
artist starts with the rubbery, synthetic surface of linoleum, and, just as in
woodcut, gouges out the areas not intended to take ink. Linoleum is softer
than wood, has no grain, and can be cut with equal ease in any direction. The
softness of this matrix material makes fine detail impossible.
A good example of a linoleum cut is I Have Special Reservations. . . by
Elizabeth Catlett (fig. 8.6). We see here the soft, relatively large gouges
typical of this medium. The strokes also go in every direction, reflecting the
lack of grain in linocut. This work is an example of socially conscious
printmaking, as it highlights the issue of race segregation, which was still
practiced when the artist made this print. The “special reservations” of the
title refers to the segregation of public transportation that was legal in the
United States until 1956. This work is one of a series that Catlett made called
The Negro Woman, in which she attempted to counteract stereotypes by
making serious and dignified images of women of her race.

A contemporary artist who uses relief techniques in an original way is
Betsabeé Romero of Mexico City (fig. 8.7). She buys used tires with the tread
almost gone, and she carves in them relief patterns that are based on
traditional Mexican popular culture motifs, such as skeletons and flowers.
The tires are easily inked for printing on long sheets, which she either sells by
the yard or exhibits together with the tires.

Intaglio
Intaglio printing is the opposite of relief printing: Areas below the surface
hold the ink (see the Intaglio diagram, fig. 8.8). The word intaglio comes
from the Italian verb intagliare, “to cut into.” The image to be printed is cut
or scratched or etched into a metal surface. To make an intaglio matrix, the
printmaker first daubs the plate with printer’s ink, then wipes the surface
clean, leaving ink only in the etched or grooved portions. Damp paper is then
placed on the inked plate, which then passes beneath a press roller. A print is
made when the dampened paper picks up the ink in the grooves. As in relief
printing, the image in the matrix is reversed in printing on paper. The
pressure of the roller creates a characteristic plate mark around the edges of
the image. Intaglio printing was traditionally done from polished copper
plates, but now zinc, steel, aluminum, and even plastic are often used.
Engraving, drypoint, and etching are the principal intaglio processes.
8.8 Intaglio.
Engraving
To make an engraving, the artist cuts lines into the polished surface of a
metal plate with a burin, or engraving tool. This exacting process takes
strength and control. Lines are made by pushing the burin into the metal to

carve a groove, removing a narrow strip of metal in the process. A clean line
is preferable; thus any rough edges of the groove must be smoothed down
with a scraper. Engraved lines cannot be freely drawn because of the pressure
needed to cut the grooves. Darker areas are shaded with various types of
cross-hatching. A successful engraving therefore requires precise, smooth
curves and parallel lines. To see a good example of engraving, look at the
United States currency; all the bills are engravings, made by experts.
We can also see the complex richness of engraved lines in Albrecht Dürer’s
engraving The Knight, Death, and the Devil (fig. 8.9). Thousands of fine lines
define the shapes, masses, spaces, values, and textures in this complex print.
The precision of Dürer’s lines seems appropriate to the subject—an image of
the noble Christian knight moving with resolute commitment, unswayed by
the forces of chaos, evil, and death that surround him.

Drypoint
Drypoint is similar to engraving. Using a pointed tool with a steel or diamond
tip, the artist scratches shallow lines into a soft copper or zinc plate. The
displaced metal leaves a burr, or rough edge, similar to the row of earth left
by a plow. The burr catches the ink and, when printed, leaves a slightly
blurred line (see the Drypoint Plate diagram, fig. 8.10). Because the burr is
fragile and deteriorates rapidly from the pressure of the printing press rollers,
drypoint editions are by necessity small and rarely done. Skillful
draftsmanship is required, for drypoint lines are difficult to execute and
almost impossible to correct. More often, artists use drypoint to put the
finishing touches on already etched plates.
8.10 Drypoint Plate.
Etching
The process of making an etching begins with the preparation of a metal
plate. The artist paints the surface of the copper or zinc plate with a coating of
either wax or varnish that will resist acid. The artist then draws easily through
this ground with a pointed tool, exposing the metal with each stroke. An

etching tool may be as thick as a pen, but is more often closer to a needle.
Finally, the plate is immersed in nitric acid. Acid bites into the plate where
the drawing has exposed the metal, making a groove that varies in depth
according to the strength of the acid and the length of time the plate is in the
acid bath.
Because they are more freely drawn, etched lines are generally more relaxed
or irregular than engraved lines. We can see the difference in line quality
between an etching and an engraving—the freedom versus the precision—by
comparing the lines in Rembrandt’s etching Christ Preaching (fig. 8.11) with
the lines in Düfrer’s engraving (see fig. 8.9).

In Christ Preaching, Rembrandt’s personal understanding of Christ’s
compassion harmonizes with the decisive yet relaxed quality of the artist’s
etched lines. This etching shows Rembrandt’s typical use of a wide range of
values, mostly created through hatching. Skillful use of light and shadow
draws attention to the figure of Christ and gives clarity and interest to the
whole image. In a composition in which each figure is similar in size,
Rembrandt identified Jesus as the key figure by setting him off with a light
area below, a light vertical band above, and implied lines of attention leading
to him from the faces of his listeners.
Etching yields only lines, but there is a way to create shaded areas in an
intaglio matrix. Aquatint is an etching process used to obtain gray areas in
black-and-white or color prints. The artist sprinkles acid-resistant powder on
the plate over parts that need a gray tone. When the plate is bathed in acid,
the exposed areas between the powder particles are eaten away to produce a
rough surface capable of holding ink. Values thus produced can vary from
light to dark, depending on how long the plate is in the acid and how thick the
dusting of powder. Because aquatint is not suited to making thin lines, it is
usually combined with a linear print process such as engraving or etching.
American artist Mary Cassatt combined a few intaglio techniques in her work
The Letter (fig. 8.12). She made the colored areas with aquatint; she
scratched the lines in the surface of the plates with drypoint. She used three
plates, one for each color.

Because the acids used in intaglio printing are highly toxic and give off
potent fumes, many contemporary intaglio artists are drawn to new nontoxic
methods. Some of these involve using different chemicals, such as dry citric
acid or ferric chloride powders, in place of the nitric acid bath. Another
method is electroetching, in which a low-wattage electric current is passed
through a solution of sulfate salts in water. This process yields a nonacidic
bath that will etch a plate without endangering the health of the artist.
Lithography
Unlike relief and intaglio methods, lithography requires no cutting of the
matrix. Thus, lithography is a surface or planographic printing process (fig.
8.13). Lithography lends itself well to a direct manner of working because the
artist draws an image directly onto the surface of the stone or plate. This
directness makes lithography faster and somewhat more spontaneous than
other methods. A lithograph is often difficult to distinguish from a crayon
drawing because many lithographic drawing tools resemble waxy pencils.

8.13 8.13 Lithography.
Using litho crayons, litho pencils, or a greasy liquid called tusche, the artist
draws the image on flat, fine-grained Bavarian limestone (or on a metal
surface that duplicates its character). After the image is complete, the stone is
chemically treated with gum arabic and a small amount of acid to fix the
drawing onto the stone. The surface is then dampened with water and inked.
The oil-based ink is repelled by water in the blank areas, but it adheres to the
greasy area of the image. As in other print processes, when the surface is
covered with paper and run through a press, the image is transferred to the
paper. Because the surface remains intact, lithographic stones or plates can be
reused after the matrix surface is scraped and washed clean.
Lithography was perfected in the early nineteenth century, and it soon had a
major impact on society because prints could be produced quickly and easily.
Before the development of modern photographic printing presses, lithographs
provided the illustrations for newspapers, posters, and handbills. Honoré
Daumier, one of the first artists who took lithography seriously, made his
living drawing satirical and documentary lithographs for French newspapers.
His fast but assured drawing style was well suited to the immediacy of the
lithographic process.
In Rue Transnonain, April 15, 1834 (fig. 8.14), Daumier carefully
reconstructed a horrible event that occurred during a period of civil unrest in

Paris in 1834. The militia claimed that a shot was fired from a building on
Transnonain Street. Soldiers responded by entering the apartment and killing
all the occupants, including many innocent people. Daumier’s lithograph of
the event was published the following day. The lithograph reflects the artist’s
feelings, but it also conveys information in the way television news programs
and websites do today. Rembrandt’s influence is evident in the composition
of strong light and dark areas that increase the dramatic impact of Daumier’s
image.

The leading European printmaker of the late nineteenth century, Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec, created many of his most innovative works using
lithography. The freedom and directness of the technique made it ideal for his
spontaneous and witty approach to subjects. In the space of about ten years,
he created hundreds of posters that advertised everything from nightclub acts
to bicycles. His use of bright colors and flattened, modern compositions
influenced graphic designers for several decades (see Henri de Toulouse-
Lautrec: Printing from Life on p. 138).
Toulouse-Lautrec had a fruitful and long-lasting friendship with the cabaret
singer Aristide Bruant. In this portrait print of his friend (fig. 8.15), we see
the artist’s creative use of the lithographic medium. He used crayons of
various widths for the lines, and tusche for the solid dark areas. He created
the white patches at the right by dropping melted wax on the stone, keeping
ink away from that part. The speckles were created by spattering, as he
flicked the bristles of an ink-laden brush.

Most books that have pictures are printed today with a version of lithography
called offset. Each page image is burned onto a metal lithographic plate and
then inked, but the ink is first transferred, or offset, onto a rubber cylinder
before printing on paper. This method, which is suited to rotary presses, gives
uniform ink depth across an entire printing. It is used to print this book and
many others.

8.16 Portrait photo of Henri de
Toulouse- Lautrec in his studio.

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864–1901) was born into comfortable
circumstances,but his parents were first cousins, which caused a genetic
difficulty that left the future artist physically handicapped and under 5 feet
tall. However, this lack of physical ability probably led him to focus more
intently on art.
Private study with academic teachers left Toulouse-Lautrec sufficiently
skilled in traditional drawing and perspective, but he set aside that knowledge
and instead followed the style of the Impressionist Edgar Degas and other
artistic rebels of the day. He also plunged heavily into the notorious nightlife
of Paris, from which he drew his principal subjects.
When his friend Aristide Bruant opened his own cabaret in 1885, Toulouse-
Lautrec became one of its most devoted patrons; the following year, Bruant
put the artist’s work on permanent display at the club. By the early 1890s,
Toulouse-Lautrec had pioneered a new style of lithographic poster, with a
large format and innovative compositions that brought him wide renown.
When the upper-crust nightclub Les Ambassade urs lured Bruant for an
engagement in its fashionable area of Champs-Elysées, the singer
commissioned Toulouse-Lautrec to design a poster (Figure 8.17.) He
responded with a rich creation in five colors, composed of a few, mostly flat,
shapes in a largerthan- usual format. Each color required a separate
lithographic stone. The deep-blue area at the upper right is a doorway where a
sailor stands. Bruant’s body fills most of the frame, bringing him close to the
picture surface, overlapping the name of the club at the top. The two zones of
the flaming-red scarf converge near Bruant’s head, leading us to confront the
singer’s distant and somewhat haughty facial expression. Toulouse-Lautrec
specialized in capturing such reserved emotional states. The poster also
reflects Toulouse- Lautrec’s careful study of the work of Japanese
printmakers, who often used flat shapes in bright colors to depict nightlife
scenes.

Stencil and Screenprinting
In simplest terms, a stencil is a sheet with a design cut out of it; painting or
spraying over the sheet transfers the design to the picture surface. Stencils are
a quick way to make lettering or repeated designs on walls, but here we will
consider them as a method for making multiple works of art.
Stencils are a favored method of street artists who communicate political
messages, because they permit fast fabrication without the need for redrawing
each time. (One such work, by the well-known street artist Banksy, is
pictured in (fig. 25.17.) A few stencil artists make objects of more subtle
design, however. One of these is Kim McCarthy, a Seattle-based artist who
also uses the alias Urban Soule. Her Urban Buddha (fig. 8.18) shows many
repeated patterns in the background that she achieved with stencils using blue
and green paint. The black skulls and the dominant Buddha image were also
sprayed through stencils. The drawback to using stencils is that only positive
and negative spaces are produced; shading is not possible. McCarthy
overcame this difficulty by adding many colors, brushstrokes, and paint drips.
The trails of black and white paint suggest the quick execution of street art.

Screenprinting is a refinement of the technique of stencil printing. Early in
the twentieth century, stencil technique was improved by attaching the stencil
to a screen made of silk fabric stretched across a frame (synthetic fabric is
generally used today). With a rubber-edged blade or a squeegee, ink is then
pushed through the fabric in the open areas of the stencil to make an image of
the stencil on the paper being printed (see the Screenprinting diagram, fig.
8.19). Because silk was the traditional material used for the screen, the
process is also known as silkscreen or serigraphy (from the Latin for silk,
sericum).
8.19 Screenprinting.
Screenprinting is well suited to the production of images with areas of
uniform color. Each separate color requires a different screen, but registering

and printing are relatively simple. There is no reversal of the image in
screenprinting—in contrast to relief, intaglio, and lithographic processes, in
which the image on the plate is reversed in the printing process. The medium
also allows the production of large, nearly mass-produced editions without
loss of quality.
Silkscreen printing thus lends itself to poster production, and many social
movements have allied themselves with silkscreen artists to help spread the
word about their causes. For example, residents of the low-lying Marshall
Islands in the central Pacific have already been affected by climate change, as
rising sea levels have washed away homes and businesses during high tides.
One of the most prominent activists on this issue, Milañ Loeak, has drawn
attention to the roots of climate change in various ways, from writing opinion
pieces in newspapers to protesting the burning of coal to generate electricity.
A poster workshop in California made a silkscreen (fig. 8.20) with a portrait
of the activist along with a quote from one of her essays. This print is is both
an excellent example of silkscreen art and a memorable summation of the the
activist and her position.

A more mechanical procedure in screenprinting is the photographic stencil, or
photo screen, achieved by attaching light-sensitive gelatin to the screen
fabric. This allows the transfer of a photograph to the screenprint stencil.
Andy Warhol made such photo-based screenprints often in the 1960s and
1970s, such as Gangster Funeral (fig. 8.21), in which he reproduced a news
photo of the subject five times onto the screen. In this cemetery scene, the
two white masses in the photo are heaped-up piles of melting snow. Above
each white mass is a group of mourners standing on either side of a casket
decorated with flowers. Warhol caused the variations in the repetitions of this
photo by varying the amount of ink that the squeegee pushed through the
screen.

Contemporary Approaches
Experimental printmakers in recent years have taken on new types of printing
materials, and digital technology. More artists are also taking the idea of
multiple artworks into the third dimension. Each of these has altered the
boundaries of the medium.
Michelle Murillo uses printmaking processes in new ways. While doing
personal genealogical research, she found some official identity documents
belonging to her ancestors. She photographed these and printed them onto
sheets of sandblasted glass that she made by hand (fig. 8.22). She used a
photo-transfer process similar to silkscreening to embed the image onto the
surface of blue glass. The overall effect thus resembles a faded ID card
floating on the ocean, which is reflected in the title Adrift. This work, part of
a series with that title, highlights the frequent ocean-crossing migrations that
the artist’s ancestors made.

Many printmakers today combine printmaking techniques with other media.
One of these is Nicola López, who uses woodcut and lithography to create
installations that are specific to each exhibition. In her 2006 work Blighted
(fig. 8.23), she printed on Mylar, a transparent film. Her images of shattering
buildings and tumbling structures are based on her memories of the attacks of
September 11, 2001.

Digital technology has altered printmaking at a basic level by eliminating the
tangible plate. A digital matrix is made not by hand but with a keyboard and
mouse. Some artists make digital prints using painting and photo-editing
programs, and then erase the matrix files when the “edition” is complete. This
technology allows the creation of prints that are not original in the traditional
sense because they are infinitely reproducible. In 2007, the English duo
Gilbert and George (who do not use their last names) made a print available
for free downloading on the Internet for 36 hours. The edition was limited not
by the number of downloads, but by the clock.
The new technology of digital printing in three dimensions makes possible
another sort of editioned work. In 3-D printing, the artist creates a design in
three dimensions using modeling software. A 3-D print is not a print in the
traditional sense because it is not an impression, but we include it here
because it is a limited edition made by an artist. Brenna Murphy’s Rainbow
Array 1 (fig. 8.24) is such a work. She made it in an edition of four, which
she sold online.

Jane and Louise Wilson’s photograph The Silence is Twice as Fast
Backwards I (fig. 9.1) captures a magical moment in a lush, green forest. It
appears as if the artists went for a morning walk and stumbled upon a
wooded glade, flooded with streaking sunlight. The picture they printed is 6
feet square, filling our entire field of vision. The image seems irresistible:
Viewers may want to dive right into the scene.

The word photography literally means “light-writing,” although a more
accurate description would be “light-drawing.” Like drawing, photography

can be either a practical tool or an artform. Beyond its many uses in
journalism, science, advertising, and personal record keeping, photography
offers artists, such as Jane and Louise Wilson, a powerful means of
expression.
Beyond selecting camera, lens, and film, a skilled photographer makes many
choices about composition, angle, focus, distance, and light. The Wilson
sisters carefully composed The Silence is Twice as Fast Backwards I. The
three trees are perfectly positioned in the frame, and the branch that leads our
eye in from the lower left points upward to connect with the foliage of the
second tree. Note also how the branch at the lower right seems to parallel the
one at lower left in a rhythmic repetition. These curving branches lie at a
roughly 90-degree angle to the sun’s rays that stream in from the upper left.
The artists seem to have set the exposure of the shot perfectly, as well, so that
details are visible even in intense light and darkness. And one more fact
completes this photo’s contrivances: To create the effect of sunlight, the
artists loosed some mist into the scene before shooting it.
In this chapter we will consider how photography has evolved since the mid-
nineteenth century, from a tool for capturing the appearance of people and
places into an established artform. We will also consider its use as a means of
encouraging social change, and look at the impact of the digital revolution.

The Evolution of Photography
The basic concept of the camera preceded actual photography by many
centuries. The forerunner of the modern camera was the camera obscura,
literally “dark chamber” (fig. 9.2). Sunlight passing through a small hole in
the wall of a darkened room projects onto the opposite wall an inverted image
of whatever lies outside. In about 1000 CE, Muslim scientist Alhazen wrote
of using one to view solar eclipses safely. In the fifteenth century, artist
Leonardo da Vinci, who had read translations of Alhazen’s work, described
the device as an aid to observation and picture making. In about 1585 the
Neapolitan mathematician Giambattista della Porta placed a lens in the hole,
making the image sharper. Several artists in the seventeenth century used
tabletop-size versions to aid in drawing. The camera obscura thus already
functioned like a camera, but the means for preserving or copying its images
was still lacking.

b. Portable camera obscura.
c. Table model camera obscura.
Photography became possible when scientists discovered that certain
chemicals were sensitive to light. In about 1826, the first vague photographic
image was made by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. He recorded and fixed on a
sheet of pewter an image he made by exposing the sensitized metal plate to
natural light for almost an entire day of eight hours. During the next decade,
the painter Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre further improved Niépce’s
chemical process and produced some of the first satisfactory photographs,
known as daguerreotypes. He made them by exposing iodized silver plates in
the presence of mercury vapor; images were fixed on the plate with a mineral
salt solution. Combining this light-sensitive chemistry with a box-sized
camera obscura yielded the first camera that gave predictable results.
Daguerre first publicized his work in 1839, a convenient date for the
invention of photography.

At first, because the necessary exposure times were so long, photography
could record only stationary objects. In Daguerre’s photograph Le Boulevard
du Temple (fig. 9.3), taken in Paris in 1839, the streets appear deserted
because moving figures such as pedestrians and carriages made no lasting
light impressions on the plate. The exposure time for this plate was about a
half hour. However, one man, having his shoes shined, stayed still long
enough to become part of the image. He is visible on the corner in the lower
left, the first person ever to appear in a photograph. It was a significant
moment in human history: At last images of people and things could be made
without the hand of a trained artist.

The first common use of photography was portraiture. Before the
development of the camera, only the wealthy could afford to hire artists to
paint their portraits. But by the mid-nineteenth century most major cities had
several portrait photographers. People of average means went in great
numbers to photography studios to sit, stiff and unblinking, in bright sunlight
for five to eight seconds to have their portraits made with the camera. As the
nineteenth century progressed, shorter exposure times, less-toxic technology,
and printing on paper all helped to popularize photography.

Early Art Photography
For many years the public was reluctant to accept photography as an artform
because of its reliance on a mechanical device. And, indeed, many early
photographers were content merely to record visual information. Today,
however, most people agree that the camera can be a vehicle for personal
expression and symbolic communication.
From the beginning, portrait painting greatly influenced portrait photography.
One of the very first portrait photographers to be regarded as an artist was
Julia Margaret Cameron. By 1864, she had become an avid photographer,
creating expressive portraits. Cameron pioneered the use of close-ups and
carefully controlled lighting to enhance the images of her subjects, who were
often family members or famous friends. Her photo Paul and Virginia (fig.
9.5) shows many of her concerns. She finely crafted her exposure to allow
enough light to perfectly define the children’s round bodies and their
disheveled clothing. She posed them off-center, and created a dynamic
balance with the umbrella and its diagonal. The two children are known to us
from other photos, but Cameron titled this work after a popular novel about a
pair of shipwrecked children. She suggests the atmosphere of the novel in
both the title and the poses.

An early crusader in the art photography movement was the American Alfred
Stieglitz, who opened a photography gallery in New York City in 1905. He
also founded an influential magazine, Camera Work, which published
photography along with essays about modern art and culture.
Stieglitz’s own photography often showed influence from the delicate
shadings of the paintings of his contemporaries. His 1901 photograph Spring
Showers, New York (fig. 9.6) is a superb exercise in tonal control because it
effortlessly handles subtle gradations of texture and shade. The wet street
looks different from the sidewalk, for example, as both differ from the misty
sky with its looming buildings in the distance. The background is also out of
focus, a product of intentionally shallow depth of field. Stieglitz created and
exhibited photos to show that photographers could be as skilled as painters in
capturing and interpreting the world around them. In early photographs such
as this one, he revealed the poetry he found in everyday urban scenes.

French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson captured a subtle moment of
drama in Place de l’Europe Behind the Gare St. Lazare, Paris (fig. 9.7). Here
he released the shutter at exactly the right moment, and at the perfect shutter
speed, to capture a man leaping over a puddle on a cloudy day. The man’s
shape is echoed in both his own reflection and that of the dancer in the poster
behind, just as semicircular ripples find a parallel in the round shapes close
by in the water. For Cartier-Bresson, good photography is a matter of
capturing the decisive moment:

To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a
second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise
organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.1
If Stieglitz and Cartier-Bresson wake us up to everyday poetry that we might
not otherwise notice, Manuel Álvarez Bravo photographs jarring surprises in
his urban environment. His photo Two Pairs of Legs (fig. 9.8) combines a
billboard and a building site. The subjects of this work seem to ascend in
pairs, starting with the legs from a shoe advertisement. Above that is a pair of
lamps, and further up a pair of (doubled) windows from an office building
under construction. Other pleasant revelations await the careful viewer: the
parallel between the woman’s skirt and the shadow of the awning, which
creates a “skirt” on the man; the shadows of the lamps as they collide with
the rectilinear pieces of the billboard; the way the bodies seem to disappear
into the building above; and how the photographer’s angle of vision makes
room for the sign at the top.

Other photographers went beyond the camera itself to achieve more inventive
effects. Man Ray made innovative photographs, which he called rayographs,
by placing objects on light-sensitive paper and exposing them to sunlight.

The rayographs are photographs in which no cameras or lenses are used; they
are also visual inventions recorded on film. Sometimes, as in the work
pictured here (fig. 9.9), it is not even clear what the original subject was.

Photography and Social Change
Each generation produces its own memorable photographs. Such photographs
move us not only because of the way their subjects are presented, but also
because we know the photographer was present at the scene, allowing us to
join him or her as witnesses. The significance of such images lies not only in
their ability to inform us, but also in their power to stir our emotions.
Only a few decades after the invention of photography, photographers began
to bring public attention to suffering caused by war, poverty, hunger, and
neglect. The new tool made visual statements believable in ways that no
essay or drawing could. Of all the arts, photography is uniquely suited not
only to documenting events and social problems, but also to bringing about
empathetic awareness that can lead to reform.
An early leader in the use of photography for social change was the Danish-
born American Jacob Riis. In the late nineteenth century, he photographed
squalid living and working conditions in poor areas of New York and
published them for the world to see. Photographs such as Five Cents a Spot
(fig. 9.10) drew public attention that led to stricter housing codes and
improved work safety laws. The vividness of this photo was made possible
by the recent invention of flash photography, which allowed Riis to take his
camera into previously unseen places. His most famous book, How the Other
Half Lives, was a landmark in the social impact of photography.

For most of the twentieth century, photography enjoyed an unquestioned
reputation as a vehicle of truth, giving rise to the saying, “The camera never
lies.” During the 1930s, Margaret Bourke-White introduced the concept of
the photographic essay—an approach that other photographers soon adopted.
A photo essay is a collection of photographs on a single subject, arranged to
tell a story or convey a mood in a way not possible with a single photograph.
Bourke-White documented construction projects, industrial plants, foreign
customs, and Depression-era poverty in many such works. On assignment to
document the effects of a flood in 1937, she created African American Flood
Victims Lined Up (fig. 9.11), one of the more famous images of the
Depression in the United States.

In addition to focusing on social problems, photography has aided the efforts
of environmentalists. Ansel Adams often used his photographs to increase
public awareness of the need for conservation of the natural environment. His
Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park, California (fig. 9.12)
reflects the symphonic grandeur of nature’s design. It renders the cathedral-
like Yosemite Valley as an orchestration in black and white, where stark rock
mingles with soft mist. All is in perfect focus in an infinite depth of field,
which Adams achieved by using a high f-stop. He also carefully adjusted the
lighting during the development process by selectively exposing some parts
of the picture to more light. Adams viewed aspects of nature as symbols of
spiritual life, capable of transcending the conflicts of society. In his majestic
black-and-white photographs, nature becomes a timeless metaphor for
spiritual harmony.

Today’s environmental photographers are more likely to focus on the serious
human impact on our surroundings. For example, Chris Steele-Perkins
traveled to the Marshall Islands in the Pacific in 2004, and he found that
rising sea levels threaten the very existence of these islands. His photo from
the series Marshall Islands (fig. 9.13) shows a makeshift sea wall created out

of castoffs and junk, a desperate attempt to hold back rising tides. Steele-
Perkins is one of ten photographers who collaborated on the book and
exhibition NorthSouthEastWest: A 360° View of Climate Change, a
worldwide compendium of views of the problem.

Color Photography
Photography began as a primarily black-and-white process. Indeed, for the
first 100 years, black and white was the only practical option for
photographers. Through much of the twentieth century, technical problems
with color persisted: Film and printing papers were expensive, and color
prints faded over time. Even when fairly accurate color became practical,
many photographers felt that color lacked the abstract power of the black-
and-white image.
The development of color photography began in 1907 with the invention of
color transparencies. In 1932, the Eastman Kodak Company began making
color film. The key invention came in 1936 with Kodachrome film, which
substantially improved the versatility and accuracy of color photography.
Later progress improved the relative permanence of color prints.
Through the 1960s, most art photographers disdained color film. At first they
did so because the chemical development processes yielded unstable prints
that faded or evolved toward red over time; later, because color photographs
were associated with family snapshots and tourist photographs. But when
William Eggleston exhibited his color work at the Museum of Modern Art,
New York, in 1976, the world took notice and a new branch of art
photography was born.
Eggleston’s pictures from the Los Alamos Portfolio are elegant compositions
of everyday things. In Untitled (Nehi Bottle on Car Hood; fig. 9.14), two cars
block out an abstract composition of off-balance diagonals against a paved
background darkened by wedges of shadow. The soda bottle seems perfectly
positioned to both anchor the composition and capture the sunlight; its red
color further lends it emphasis. The blue car, being a cool color, tends to
recede. Besides the skillful arrangement, the photo rivets our attention
because it immediately evokes a world: a casual social setting in some
American rural area on a warm afternoon. To prove the validity of
Eggleston’s commitment to color photography, all we have to do is imagine
this work in black and white.

Pushing the Limits
Artists have recently explored a variety of techniques to go beyond
photography’s assumed limits. British artist Susan Derges lays large sheets of
photosensitive paper on the bottom of shallow ponds at night, and captures
the look of the night sky through the water. She often shines a flashlight on
the paper through surrounding bushes to compose ghostly night scenes with
their shadows (fig. 9.15). She thus creates landscapes of a new kind, as if we
were looking up from below the water’s surface.

Trevor Paglen pushes the limits of the camera in a way that highlights
contemporary questions about government secrecy. For his project called
Limit Telephotography, he approached secret government installations,
getting as close as he could legally as a private citizen. Many of these
facilities are in remote locations in the desert West. He then photographed the
secret sites with the best equipment commercially available. One work from
this series is Open Hangar, Cactus Flats, NV, Distance ~ 18 miles, 10:04
a.m. (fig. 9.16). The results are unsurprisingly blurry, but still tantalizing
because his cameras can see far better than the unaided eye. Cactus Flat is a
secret military installation where controllers pilot reconnaissance drones in
war-torn or forbidden areas of the world. It is also part of the Tonopah Test
Range, which is described rather mysteriously on its website as “the testing
range of choice for all national security missions.” Paglen’s photo represents
the citizen’s eye, straining to learn even a bit of information about what our
government is doing.

Vietnamese-born artist Binh Danh invented his own method of recording
photographs onto plant material. He takes or borrows photographs and then
attaches them to leaves from his garden. He then places the leaf and photo
between layers of glass, and exposes them outdoors for up to several weeks
on the roof of his house. The sunlight transfers the photographic images to
the leaves, in a process he calls chlorophyll printing.

Danh most often uses images of the victims of warfare in Southeast Asia to
create haunting works that memorialize the dead. The face that emerges from
the leaf in Iridescence of Life #7 (fig. 9.17) came from the Genocide Museum
in Cambodia, which holds thousands of photos that the Khmer Rouge
methodically took of their victims. In this work Danh embedded the printed
leaves in resin, and paired them with butterfly specimens. The resulting work
seems fragile, precious, and beautiful. Danh said, “I have tried to show how
like plants humans are; we participate in the kinetics of events and the
process of creating memories by absorbing the history around us—and, like
leaves, we wither and eventually die. The residue of our existence nourishes
the memories of the living like a decaying leaf nourishes the soil.”2

Danh’s interest in chemical photo processes also led him to explore the
ancient medium of the daguerreotype (see Binh Danh: Exhuming the
Landscape on p. 155).

If a photograph is a repository for memories, then Binh Danh (b. 1977) is
creating them for both himself and his viewers. At the time of his birth in
Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge regime in neighboring Cambodia was eliminating
dissidents of all kinds in a genocide that eventually claimed nearly two
million victims. Danh migrated to the United States with his refugee parents
in 1979. His unique versions of photography poetically reconstruct a difficult
past.
“I am half Cambodian,” Danh said. “My father is Cambodian and my mother
is Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge were pretty much exterminating any
foreigners in the country, including people who wore glasses, who drank
milk, who were artists, or Buddhist monks, Catholic nuns.”3 Because he has
no memory of his homeland, he reconstructed it through the landscape. “You
could call me a landscape photographer, because I’m looking at the
landscape, but instead of just photographing the landscape, I’m looking into
the landscape, into the earth, underneath the soil, into the cells of plants.”4
Danh took an interest in the daguerreotype process, in which an image is
exposed on a treated silver plate sensitized with vapor. “They called the
daguerreotype a mirror with a memory; it is a mirror you hold up to yourself,
and it remembers who you are; it has a ghostly quality to it.”5 He bought
several antique box cameras, fitted them for daguerreotype plates, and took
them to Yosemite National Park, where he resolved to photograph in the
footsteps of Ansel Adams and others (fig. 9.19). Surprisingly, he is the first
daguerreotypist to visit Yosemite.

The daguerreotype process is difficult to carry out in a remote location. Danh

described it: “I go to Yosemite with a van, which I have converted to a
darkroom. I call the van ‘Louis’ after Louis Daguerre. I’m in the van with a
[silver] plate, which I have polished to a high finish. I sensitize the plate with
iodine vapor. When the iodine comes into contact with the silver, the plate
becomes light sensitive. From there I put it in a plate holder with my camera
and go hiking. I’ll find a spot and make an exposure, come back to the van
and develop the plate.”6 Exposures take between one and two minutes, so he
has to avoid shooting on windy days.
Viewers who see these images, as with any daguerreotype, also see
themselves reflected in the silver plate, placing themselves in the image. The
plates that Danh uses are larger than most nineteenth-century plates, partly to
facilitate this mirroring quality for viewers. Danh further explained, “These
specific photographic processes allow me to exhume the landscape and all of
its metaphors. I consider this work social documentary. For me, social
documentary examines historical events and their relation to our
contemporary lives.”7

The Digital Revolution
Near the end of the twentieth century, the chemical photographic negative
began to go out of fashion under the impact of the new digital technology.
While photochemical film is still manufactured and sold, the convenience of
digital photography is causing the slow decline of the older process. Trevor
Paglen, for example, uses only digital cameras. Now most cameras do not use
film; rather, the lens focuses information onto sensors that translate light into
digital files. Using photo-editing computer programs, these files can be
manipulated in almost infinite ways, and reproduced endlessly.
The implications of these changes are profound. If a photo can be altered in
almost any imaginable way, then its reputation as a vehicle of truth has
expired, and the camera can indeed lie. Moreover, the reproducibility of
images means that the specialness of a photograph is much reduced. Many
contemporary photographers take advantage of these facts.
Jeff Wall, for example, calls himself a “near-documentary” photographer. He
creates scenes that seem vividly “real,” yet they retain a decidedly stagy
quality. Boy Falls from Tree (fig. 9.20) seems a matter-of-fact photo of an
unfortunate (but not entirely uncommon) event. Yet Wall created it at his
computer by combining several related photos. Photographing the falling boy
in motion would require a fast shutter speed that would greatly limit the depth
of field. But today’s digital cameras enable such effects. Wall also takes full
advantage of the high-resolution technology by blowing up his pictures to
maximum size, in this case about 8 by 10 feet. We are left wondering what is
real and what is manipulated in this too-perfect picture of a minor calamity.

Tree. 2010. Color photograph.

If Jeff Wall hides his manipulation of the photos he takes to make them
appear natural, other photographers explicitly maximize the editing potential
of software to create vivid and complex images. One of these is James
Welling, who began his career using film but eagerly embraced the new
technology as it developed.
Welling’s 2016 photo 9812 (fig. 9.21) is one of a series in which he layered
together photos of modern dance companies, landscapes, and government
buildings. This photo includes the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance
Company, the Nova installation by Soft Lab in Madison Square Park, New
York City, and the Orange County Government Center in Goshen, New

York. Welling saturated each of the three source photos in red, green, and
blue, the basic colors of digital photography; then he mixed them together as
adjustment layers in Photoshop. The result is a highly dynamic collage of a
figure in a dense backdrop with splashes of rich digital color. Welling uses
software to create almost as a painter might, arranging forms in a constructed
space with applied color. He prints his photos in high resolution and large
format to increase the impact. When he exhibits the works from this series, he
also makes available a booklet for viewers that sets forth all the steps he took
to reach the final images.

internationally from the 1930s.
4. 10.4 Explain the impact of the digital revolution on special effects and
movie production.
5. 10.5 Summarize the use of digital video as an art medium.
6. 10.6 Discuss how artists today use computers to produce digital

The first experimental color movie seen in Germany had to be shown under
false pretenses. The year was 1933 and the work was Circles by Oskar
Fischinger (fig. 10.1). It was a nonrepresentational movie, composed of
dancing and interlocking rings and circles that moved and evolved across the
screen, accompanied by dramatic orchestral music. Only a few minutes in
length, it was screened together with entertaining black-and-white features.
The public seemed to enjoy Fischinger’s experiment in color and form.

However, those were the years in which the Nazi party suppressed all forms
of abstract and nonrepresentational art, which they regarded as “degenerate.”
In order to avoid such censorship, Fischinger made Circles as an
advertisement for a public relations company; the last few moments of the
movie display the name of the company and an advertising slogan. Finding
Nazi browbeating intolerable, Fischinger left Germany for Los Angeles in
1936.
This story illustrates two important points about cinema: First, that it is a
mass art closely monitored by those in authority; and second, that creative
people have been making experimental cinema for generations. In this

chapter we will examine the origins of cinema and trace the development of
innovations and techniques through movies that have broken new creative
ground, some in the mass market and others in smaller, more artistic circles.
We will also look at the impact of new technology on special effects and
production, and consider how the digital revolution has led to the creation of
new artforms and new ways of presenting artworks.

Silent Cinema: Innovations and
Techniques
Much of the power of cinema comes from its ability to reconstruct time. A
movie is not inhibited by the constraints of clock time; it can convincingly
present the past, the present, and the future, or it can mix all three in any
manner. Cinematic time can affect us more deeply than clock time, because
sequences can be constructed to approximate the way we feel about time. In
addition to editing, cinema can also manipulate time by slowing or
accelerating motion. The director’s control over time, sequence, light, camera
angle, and distance can create a feeling of total, enveloping experience so
believable that it becomes a new kind of reality.
One of the first important directors to pioneer certain effects of
cinematography (the art of movie photography and camerawork) was the
Frenchman Georges Méliès, who began his career as a magician. Between
1896 and 1913 he directed over 500 movies, most of them just a few minutes
in length and based on narration of a single event. He built his movies from a
succession of shots, which are brief unbroken sequences of recorded action.
Between them he used dissolves (fading instead of rapid cutting). Showing
his roots in the world of magic, he also perfected visual effects such as time-
lapse photography (giving the illusion of very fast motion) and
disappearances (freezing the shooting, removing an actor or item, and
continuing). The fantasy Le Voyage dans la lune (A Voyage to the Moon)
(fig. 10.3) is among his most highly regarded movies. Four astronauts climb
into a bullet-shaped projectile and are shot out of a huge cannon. On the lunar
surface, they find a culture based on the popular conception of traditional
Pacific Islanders. Because silent movies did not depend on spoken language,
they were enjoyed across the Western world.

Between 1907 and 1916, American director D. W. Griffith helped to bring
the motion picture from its infancy as an amusement to fuller stature as a
means of artistic expression. Griffith introduced the moving camera by
releasing it from its fixed, stagebound position in order to better express
narrative content. The camera was placed where it would best reveal the
dramatic meaning of each scene. A scene thus came to be composed of
several shots taken from different angles, thereby greatly increasing the

viewer’s feeling of involvement.
Assembling a scene from several shots involves film editing, a process in
which the editor selects the best shots from raw footage, then reassembles
them into meaningful sequences and finally into a total, unified progression.
Later, Griffith used parallel editing to compare events occurring at the same
time in different places or in different times, such as a person in danger and
the approach of a would-be rescuer. He used this technique in his feature
Intolerance (fig. 10.4), in which he cut back and forth among four stories
about intolerance of various kinds set in four periods of history.

Griffith was the first to use the close-up and the long shot. Today, the close-
up is one of the most widely used shots; but when Griffith first wanted to try
a close shot, his cameraman balked at the idea of a head without a body! In a
long shot the camera photographs from a distance to emphasize large groups
of people or a panoramic setting.
Several other early shot innovations came from Russian directors. Director
Lev Kuleshov, for example, discovered that viewers’ emotions from one shot
persist into the next, even if they are unrelated in content. A shot of a smiling
actor followed by a shot of a plate of food will make the food seem attractive;
if the actor is scowling or grimacing, the food will likely seem repugnant.
This technique, still widely used in movies, is called the Kuleshov effect.
Another important innovative Russian director was Sergei Eisenstein.
Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, he emerged as a major director,
honored as much in the West as in Russia. Eisenstein greatly admired
Griffith’s directorial techniques, but he developed them further, becoming
one of the first directors to produce epic features of high quality.
One of Eisenstein’s major contributions was his skilled use of montage to
heighten dramatic intensity. He adapted Griffith’s editing technique of
combining a number of very brief shots, representing distinct but related
subject matter, in order to create new relationships, build strong emotion, or
indicate the passage of time. With the use of montage, a great deal seems to
happen simultaneously, in a short time.
In his movie Battleship Potemkin (fig. 10.5), Eisenstein created one of the
most powerful sequences in cinema history: the terrible climax of a failed
revolt as army troops crush a protest. The montage of brief shots, edited into
a sequence of no more than a few minutes, effectively portrays the tragedy of
the historic event. Rather than shoot the entire scene with a wide-angle lens
from a spectator’s perspective, Eisenstein intermixed many close-ups to give
viewers the sensation of being caught as participants in the middle of the
violence. The juxtaposition of close-ups and long shots gives audiences a

powerful sense of the people’s fear and the tragedy that took place.

A movie resembles a collective dream, in which a group of people sitting in
the dark experience the same vivid story. In 1929, Surrealist artists Salvador
Dalí and Luis Buũuel took advantage of this fact when they made Un Chien
Andalou (An Andalusian Dog) (fig. 10.6). Like our dreams, the movie is a
sequence of seemingly unrelated and irrational events: Ants crawl out of a
man’s palm; two dead donkeys lie bleeding in a pair of grand pianos; a
woman’s eye is sliced open with a razor. The overall theme of the picture
seems to be unrealized sexual desire, and at the end the man and woman are
frozen half-buried in the soil like a pair of statues. The manifest illogic of An
Andalusian Dog influenced the hallucinatory content of music videos decades
later.

An Andalusian Dog is silent with a musical accompaniment, but in fact
synchronized sound had been introduced two years earlier. By 1930, almost
all movies had sound. “Talkies,” as they were called, required subtitles for
foreign audiences, making it less easy for the movies to cross international
boundaries. Color was also introduced during the 1930s; the wide screen and
three-dimensional images in the 1950s.

From the Talkies to the Seventies
Beginning in the 1930s, movie studios grew into larger companies, each
contracting its own producers, directors, technicians, and actors. These firms
would control most mass-market cinema through the 1960s.
Hollywood, with its large studios, became the production site for the vast
majority of the world’s movies in the 1930s. Beginning in mid-1934, the
major Hollywood studios all adhered voluntarily to the Motion Picture
Production Code, which attempted to regulate the moral content of movies.
The Code forbade profanity in the script, as well as depictions of nudity,
sexual activity, drug use, interracial romance, and ridicule of the clergy. It
also prohibited the glamorization of crime, so that all criminals had to be
arrested or killed in the end. Studios submitted scripts to the Code authorities
prior to shooting, and any feature that lacked a Code seal of approval had no
chance of wide distribution. At times, Code strictures were relaxed
somewhat: Clark Gable’s famous farewell to Vivien Leigh in Gone With the
Wind (“Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn”) remained in the movie, but
the producer paid a fine of $5,000 for it. The Code’s authority declined in
succeeding decades, but remained in effect until 1968, when the Motion
Picture Association of America introduced the ratings system that is still in
force today.
In the 1930s and 1940s, animators from the Walt Disney studio meticulously
explored the possibilities of animation, in which hand-drawn frames are
photographed and projected in sequence to create the illusion of motion.
Disney was the first to create an animated feature-length movie, Fantasia, in
1940. This was a new type of movie that integrated classical music, painting,
dance, and drama with a mix of human cartoon characters as the stars.
Ideas for such animations were initially portrayed on storyboards (a series of
drawings or paintings arranged in sequence), which were then used to
visualize the major shots that make up a movie. Layout artists made the story
come alive as the spatial relationships were worked out, and animators then
dramatized individual characters in each action sequence. Disney’s goal was

always to create characters who gave the illusion—at 24 frames per second—
that they were not just moving, but also thinking and feeling.
Many movie critics rank the 1941 movie Citizen Kane (fig. 10.7) as a
landmark in cinema. Orson Welles co-wrote the script, directed, and played
the leading role in the thinly disguised biography of the newspaper tycoon
William Randolph Hearst. Because of its aesthetic quality and meaningful
social message, Citizen Kane immediately set new standards for directing.
The movie employs an unprecedented array of cinematic devices: dramatic
lighting that communicates feeling, distorted lenses, dialog that bridges
breaks between scenes, and clever editing to show the passage of time.
Welles and his cinematographer, Gregg Toland, also pioneered the use of
extreme camera angles. The low-angle camera presents Kane (Welles) as a
towering presence; another such angle is the tilt, which emphasizes Kane’s
crooked politics. The movie is also important for the life that it portrays.
Hearst was the prototype of the media mogul who achieves fame and wealth
by selling sensational news (“If the headline is big enough, it makes the news
big enough,” he says).

During the 1940s, a new style called film noir originated in Hollywood.
These dark and brooding black-and-white movies usually dealt with murder,
sometimes committed by professional criminals, but more often by ordinary
folks down on their luck who are tempted at the wrong moment. These
movies depict the dark side of the American Dream, few of them more grimly
than Detour (fig. 10.8), in which the main character tries to illicitly collect a
dead man’s large inheritance, but ends up as a suspect in two murders. The

film noir genre is based primarily on American detective fiction, shot with
expressive lighting and camera-angle techniques borrowed from Citizen Kane
and the Europeans.

Despite Hollywood’s numerical dominance in movie production in the
postwar period, many foreign directors also made groundbreaking movies.
Many of these international creations used more creative cinematography or
told stories never made in Hollywood. One of the former was the Japanese
director Akira Kurosawa, who often adapted European plays and stories for

filtering through his own vision. One of these works was Throne of Blood
(fig. 10.9), in which he retold the story of Shakespeare’s Macbeth in an
ancient Japanese setting. The actors used techniques from traditional
Japanese theater as they interpreted the tale. Kurosawa typically composed
every shot very carefully, as if it were a painting. He frequently used long
lenses, placing more than one camera at a distance from an actor in order to
elicit a more natural performance. He also used wide-angle lenses to provide
more scope for composition. Trained as a painter before becoming a director,
he often drew and painted his own storyboards as he developed the various
shots into a movie. His visual style owed more to such pictorial composition
than to other factors such as montage. Western directors, in turn, have
adapted or remade many of Kurosawa’s movies; the plot of Star Wars, for
example, owes a great deal to Kurosawa’s 1958 action adventure feature The
Hidden Fortress.

A leading international director who told non-Hollywood stories was the
Italian Federico Fellini. His 1961 movie La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life)
foreshadows many of today’s critiques of the mass media (fig. 10.10).
Marcello Mastroianni plays the lead character, a tabloid journalist (also
named Marcello) who makes his career reporting on sensations, scandals, and
celebrities.

The protagonist follows the lifestyles of the rich and famous, dutifully
attending spectacles of all kinds, from the exploits of American movie stars
to decadent parties to religious visions. He frolics in a fountain at 4 AM with
a starlet. He joins the media circus as thousands throng to a small town where
two children say they saw the Virgin Mary. One of these fellow travelers is a
photographer friend nicknamed Paparazzo (after the “pop” of the camera
flash), and, ever since this movie’s release, intrusive photographers
throughout the world have been called paparazzi. The movie’s construction
facilitates its message: The director criticizes the sweet life by plunging into
it, with long and loosely connected scenes.
Experimental Cinema
Only occasionally did the careers of artists intersect successfully with those
of Hollywood directors and studios. In the late 1930s, Walt Disney recruited
Oskar Fischinger to collaborate on Fantasia, but the partnership was not a
success because Disney opposed Fischinger’s commitment to abstract art. In
1945, however, Alfred Hitchcock worked more fruitfully with Salvador Dalí
to create a dream sequence for Spellbound, in which lead character Gregory
Peck relates a dream that unlocks his amnesia. By the 1960s, the separation
between artists and directors was as complete as it would ever be. Most
artists who made movies considered their work “underground” and showed it
mostly in galleries and art venues where such experimental cinema could
flourish.
An early leader in the underground cinema movement was Stan Brakhage. In
the late 1950s, he began painting directly on raw film and then scratching
through it to create abstract movies. In 1959, he filmed the birth of his first
child, a subject forbidden by the Production Code. His most famous movie is
the feature-length Dog Star Man (fig. 10.11). A radical experiment in film
editing, this movie combines shots of a man walking his dog in a snowy

forest with shots of the night sky, the sun’s surface, and other material. Some
shots are hand-painted by the artist; others use distorting lenses. Although the
movie has no clear plot, its theme of the creation of the universe slowly
dawns on the viewer.

Sometimes an artist’s experimental movie influenced the mainstream, as
happened with Kenneth Anger’s Scorpio Rising (fig. 10.12). This 1964 work
is in effect a documentary about the rituals of a Brooklyn motorcycle gang.

They fix their bikes, go to parties, take drugs, and even suffer deadly crashes.
Anger filmed it all in highly saturated color above a soundtrack of pop songs
of the day. Scorpio Rising memorably creates a world, with intercut footage
from other movies and music that comments on the main action. The movie
strongly influenced the later idea of the “biker movie,” and Hollywood
directors such as Stephen Spielberg and Martin Scorsese have said that its
mood-creating qualities also influenced their own work.

The Seventies
Increasing competition from television took a toll on movie attendance,

which decreased the power and influence of the studios. Moreover, the
decline of the Production Code in the late 1960s released studio-based
directors to explore formerly restricted story lines regarding relationships,
race, violence, and sexuality. This led many of them to rethink the old movie
types, experimenting with characters and plots in Westerns, thrillers,
romances, and others. Robert Altman was a leader in this reconsideration
with The Long Goodbye (fig. 10.13), a witty and knowing detective story
adapted from a famous novel. The main character is Philip Marlowe, a
hapless but hardworking private eye, set adrift in sunny and self-centered
1970s Los Angeles. He copes (barely) with several gangsters, a less-than-
honest best friend, neighbors who meditate outdoors in the nude, and abusive
police who suspect him of murder. Altman inserted many deft touches: Every
time Marlowe appears in any scene, he lights a cigarette; the musical score
consists of one song, played in myriad arrangements; numerous references to
previous detective movies ricochet through the script. The Long Goodbye
repays study of earlier movies, and awareness of cinematic conventions,
because it satirizes or undercuts many of them.

Another 1970s detective movie that innovated in a different direction was
Shaft. As an outgrowth of the civil rights movement, ethnic minorities began
to advance in Hollywood during that decade. This trend began with the
blaxploitation movement, in which studios employed African-American
directors and actors in action-adventure movies that were set mostly in urban
neighborhoods.
Shaft was an early example of this new type of movie that proved successful
with white audiences as well, much to the surprise of the producers. A black
gang leader hires street-wise private investigator John Shaft to rescue his
daughter, who has been kidnapped by the Mafia (fig. 10.14). The plot is basic
to Hollywood but the movie, directed by well-known photographer Gordon
Parks, shows gritty urban life in Harlem with new clarity. The Shaft character
who navigates the stormy script is both well-dressed and ruthless; he gets the
job done by allying with an African-American revolutionary group. The
blaxploitation movement was controversial because it seemed at times to
reinforce stereotypes. But this movie’s visual style, magnetic lead character,
and award-winning score by Isaac Hayes potently influenced later urban hip-
hop culture. It also engendered several sequels, knock-offs, and remakes.

Graphic Design
Of all artforms, we encounter graphic design most frequently in our daily life.
We interact with graphic design almost constantly; most designers have
chosen it as their profession because they relish that close interaction with
people in all situations. Our encounters with graphic design are usually casual
and unintended; we do not seek out design the way we might seek other
artforms in a gallery or museum. This fact gives graphic designers an
unequalled opportunity to attract, inform, persuade, delight, bore, offend, or
repel us.
The term “graphic design” refers to the process of working with words and
pictures to enhance visual communication. Much of graphic design involves
designing materials to be printed or viewed on a screen, including books,
magazines, posters, and imagery for electronic media. Such design ranges in
scale and complexity from postage stamps and trademarks to magazine
pages, film, video, personal digital screens, websites, and apps.
Graphic design is a creative process employing art and technology to
communicate ideas. Using symbols, type, color, and illustration, the graphic
designer produces visual compositions meant to attract, inform, and persuade
a given audience. A good graphic designer can memorably arrange text and
image for the benefit of both.
Typography
Typography is the art and technique of composing printed material from
letterforms, or designing letterforms themselves. A complete set of
letterforms, including all capitals, lower case, numerals, and accent marks is a
typeface, also called a font. Designers, hired to meet clients’ communication
needs, frequently create designs that relate nonverbal images and printed
words in complementary ways.
Just a few decades ago, when people committed words to paper, their efforts

were handwritten or typewritten—and nearly all typewriters had the same
typeface, the name of which was unknown to most users. Now anyone who
uses a computer can select fonts and create documents that look professional,
producing desktop publications such as newsletters, brochures, and Web
pages. But computer programs, like pencils, paintbrushes, and cameras, are
simply tools: They can facilitate artistic aims if their operator has artistic
sensibilities. Recording artist Kanye West recently underlined the importance
of typography when he stated, “I get emotional with fonts, spacing,
proportion.”1
Since the Chinese invention of printing in the eleventh century, thousands of
typefaces have been created—helped recently by digital technology. This text
uses Adobe Garamond for its elegance and readability.
Many European-style typefaces are based on the capital letters carved in
stone by early Romans. Roman letters are made with thick and thin strokes
ending in serifs—short lines with pointed ends, at an angle to the main
strokes. The capital letter H in a Roman type of font has four serifs, one at
each extremity. In typesetting, the term “roman” is used to mean “not italic.”
Sans serif (without serifs) typefaces have a modern look thanks to their
association with modernist designs. They are actually ancient in origin.
typefaces are based on Northern medieval manuscripts.
Today, many type designers are redesigning and updating old fonts, keeping
in mind readability and contemporary preferences. We see the typographer’s
art in action with the Clearview Hwy typeface (fig. 11.2).

Donald Meeker and his associates designed this font because they thought
they could improve the readability of white-on-green Interstate freeway signs.
Using the existing font as a starting point, they expanded the hollow spaces in
the lower-case letters, such as e’s and a’s, and they narrowed the size ratio

between lower- and upper-case letters. They made many other more subtle
changes, such as adding a base to the lower-case l. The Federal Highway
Administration tested the new font in all kinds of weather and lighting
conditions, with drivers of varying visual acuity, and they found that it was
more quickly legible than the old typeface. They approved this new font for
Interstate highway signs in 2004, and it is gradually replacing the old one
across the United States, as new signs are required.
Heidi Cody took a more ironic stance with her 2000 work American Alphabet
(fig. 11.3). She found all 26 alphabet letters in the initials of corporate logos.
She said, “I try to get viewers to consciously acknowledge how indoctrinated,
or ′branded’ they are.”2

Jonathan Cuervo Cisneros is another typographer who redesigns and updates
old fonts. He recently created the new font Febrile (fig. 11.4), based on black
letter typefaces found on documents in colonial Latin America. He slanted
the letters backward and added frilly details to the capitals.

These changes reflect the nervous excitement or energy in the meaning of the
word febrile. Like many typographers today, he created the font digitally and
offers it for sale on his website.
Logos
In our age, when image seems to be everything, companies spend large sums
on graphic design to present the best “identity package.” A logo is an
identifying mark, or trademark, based on letterforms combined with pictorial
elements. Corporations finely calibrate such designs to present a distinctive
and memorable appearance.
Let us examine logos from two banks to see the messages that they carry as
simple symbols. The artist group Superflex recently appropriated the logos
for artworks, stripping away their associated typography; this creates an
opportunity to examine how logos themselves communicate. The Sovereign
Bank logo (fig. 11.5a) is a lantern that sheds light. It looks radiant, but also
prim and traditional, which is what many people imagine banks to be. The
logo for Colonial Bank is based on the letter C, which is turned into a lighted
orb like the sun (fig. 11.5b). The image of the eagle in the C suggests the bald
eagle that symbolizes the United States; this eagle seems to stand guard,
peering off into the distance, as vigilant as one might hope for in a banker.
The color blue is like the sky, reassuring and indicative of fair weather. The
messages of these two logos could not, however, prevent the two banks from
failing during the mortgage crisis of 2008; this made possible the action that
Superflex took, turning the logos into artworks on banners.

Posters and Other Graphics
A poster combines type and images in a single panel designed to provide
information. An effective poster will, in a flash, both attract attention and
convey its message. The creativity of a poster designer is directed toward a
specific purpose, which may be to advertise or to persuade.
The concept of the modern poster is more than 100 years old. In the
nineteenth century, most posters were lithographs, and many artists made
extra income by designing them. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was the most
important of these (see fig. 8.17). Early lithographic posters were all hand-
drawn; designers added color to their work by printing the same sheet with
multiple stones, one for each color. In the 1920s and 1930s, advances in

printing methods made high-quality mass production possible, including the
printing of photographs at large scale with text. Since the 1950s, radio,
television, and print advertising have overshadowed posters. Although they
now play a lesser role than they once did, well-designed posters can still
fulfill needs for instant communication.
Many social causes find vivid expression in posters. The Black Panther Party,
an African-American activist organization, made many creative (and militant)
posters in the 1960s and 1970s. Near the same time, the Chicano movement
commissioned many artists to make silkscreens promoting the causes of
Mexican Americans. (An example of the latter is the poster by JesÚs Barraza;
see fig. 8.20). In the 1980s and 1990s, the Guerrilla Girls made activist
posters protesting the inadequate representation of women in the art world.
Their poster about the Metropolitan Museum of Art (fig. 11.6) uses a nude
figure from a famous nineteenth-century painting. The oversized gorilla mask
was the standard headgear for the group when they made public appearances.
The bright yellow background with its sans serif font immediately draws
attention as well. The Guerrilla Girls plastered these posters in many
locations near the museum and in other parts of New York City where
galleries were located.

Chaz Maviyane-Davies makes posters for both the Internet and street use. He
often works without a commission, but rather for self-expression and from a
desire to inform and arouse the public about urgent issues. His recent poster
on the refugee problem (fig. 11.7) uses negative space to suggest the
worldwide nature of the problem, while the type reminds us plainly of the
human right to seek asylum. He distributed this poster electronically to his
mailing list and sold the paper version on his website at a non-profit price.

Humor has great appeal in design. The advertising poster for the television
show Portlandia (fig. 11.8) was based on a studio photo of two stars of the
show dressed as urban hipsters posing stiffly next to clichés that refer to the
northwestern city of Portland. The backdrop is obviously painted onto the
wall, as we see from the window frame at the right. The format of this poster

makes it appropriate for both outdoor and magazine use.

English designer Jonathan Barnbrook mocked the media overload that seems

to accompany every renewal of the Olympic Games. For the 2010 Winter
Games, Barnbrook and his firm Virus Fonts created a set of pictograms called
Olympukes. One of the set was called Drowning in Advertising (fig. 11.9). In
a sea of deep-red and wavy lines borrowed from the logo of a famous brand
of soft drink, we see the head and arm of a submerged consumer calling for
help. Barnbrook and Virus Fonts designed this Olympuke as iPhone

Book covers function like corporate logos, uniting image and text to extend
the message of a book and condense it into a single memorable page that
shoppers will see online or in bookstores. Book cover design is a specialized
field that has not gone out of style with the rise of digital books. Janet
Hansen’s cover for Voices in the Night (fig. 11.10) suggests a turned-down
bedsheet. The curving black-and-white lines also recall lines of type on pages
that we turn. Even digital reading devices simulate the turning of paper
pages.

Motion Graphics
Logos, posters, and book covers are generally static objects, but today a
growing design field is motion graphics, in which a designer uses visual
effects, live action, and animation to create a two-dimensional project that
moves. Designers combine these techniques in various ways for time-based
sequences in websites, television commercials, public signage, and music
videos.
Motion graphics as a discipline began with title sequences for Hollywood
movies, the roll of credits at the beginning of a movie. Most title sequences
were merely slow scrolls of names until the arrival of Saul Bass in the early
1960s. Bass said in an interview that an opening title sequence for a movie
can “create a climate for the story that is to follow,” because “the audience
involvement with a film should really begin with the first frame.”3
The arrival of advanced digital editing in the 1990s ensured the takeoff of
motion graphics. The new computer applications enable designers to create
each frame of a sequence with all the freedom that photo-editing allows.
Thus, motion graphics designers are increasingly directors of short but
intense projects that combine input from many sources.
The most original use of the new technologies came with Kyle Cooper’s
work on the title sequence for Se7en (fig. 11.11), a dramatic crime story. The
title sequence has a plot of its own, as a man with bandaged fingers
assembles and stitches together a booklet about murder and sexual deviance.
Layered images, film clips, and spoiled type nervously twitch across the
screen along with the hand-lettered credits, over a soundtrack by Nine Inch
Nails. Most important, this haunting close-up sequence has a function in the
script: It introduces the audience to the mind of the killer, who does not
appear until 40 minutes into the film. Cooper said that his aptitude for vivid
graphics came in part from his earlier study at Yale with Paul Rand, one of
America’s legendary designers.

Although title sequences are a digital medium, many motion graphics
designers still crave the hand-drawn look. Karin Fong, for example, created a
fast-moving and revealing sequence for the television series Rubicon (fig.
11.12). The main character of the series is an intelligence analyst who, as he
investigates the suspicious death of his mentor, begins to uncover a wide-
ranging conspiracy among a secret society of war profiteers. The title
sequence follows a hand-drawn yellow chalk line through lists of data, pages
of computer printouts, barcodes, maps, censored documents, aerial
photographs, and short film clips. It hints at a person searching for
connections among clues found in various kinds of evidence, just as the lead
character of the series does. The clues and hunches that he follows in his

investigation are foreshadowed in the opening title sequence, which
combines still images, animations, live action, and sound. Rubicon lasted for
just one season, but Fong’s title sequence was nominated for an Emmy
award. Fong also creates motion graphics for various other media, including
video games and advertisements (see Karin Fong: Animating New Narratives
on p. 184).

CREATORS
Karin Fong: Animating New Narratives
11.13 Karin Fong.
Courtesy of Imaginary Forces.
Karin Fong (b. 1971) began her design career at a very young age. She
recalled, “I always was a designer before I knew what to call it. I spent my
childhood making my own newspapers, books, and comics that my dad
would take to work and ‘publish’ for me on a Xerox machine.”4 This led her
to Yale University, where her senior project was an animated children’s
book. Animating graphics was a leading-edge idea at the time, as digital
animation was still in its infancy. After graduation, she was among the
founders of Imaginary Forces, one of the leading motion-graphics design
firms.
Fong’s specialty is title sequences for movies and television programs (see
fig. 11.12). “I always think a great main title is a little bit like the curtain
opening,” she says. It invites the audience to “leave the real world and go into
this other place.”5

Creating a motion-graphics title sequence involves shaping many types of
media into a cohesive whole. Fong describes the birth of a project: “The
process usually begins with a conversation with the film’s director. From
there we bounce around ideas. Sometimes there’s a concept outlined in the
script, but often there are just some basic themes to explore. That’s one of my
favorite stages: the research and design phase where we try to learn all we
can about the film and its world. From there many ideas can bloom, and we
often work on a few storyboards to flush something out. We’ll brainstorm
different ways to enter into the story.”6
Motion-graphics designers today create in a wide variety of media. Fong has
also designed a trailer for the video game God of War: Ascension, and a
television advertisement for Target stores that starred Christina Aguilera as a
comic-book superhero. One project for the Lincoln Center for the Performing
Arts in New York required the coining of a new name: an Infopeel (fig.
11.14), which is a template of moving shapes, with spaces for the insertion of
dates of upcoming events and photos of the performers. The goal was to
create a design that attracted the attention of moving viewers, while directing
their eyes to the information. Pedestrians and motorists who cross that busy
Broadway intersection can now inform themselves about Lincoln Center
programming without stopping.

“I have always been interested in the relationship between image, story, and
word,” Fong says. Motion graphics today provides “opportunities for new
narrative structures and new ways of telling a story,” aided by the latest

software and technology. “The world of filmmaking is opening up,” she says,
“because people are accepting—and expecting—the integration of animation
and live action and type. So it’s becoming a new language, and that’s very
exciting.”7

Interactive Design
As more and more of our media become interactive, designers work to
organize the information presented and keep the designs attractive. This is a
relatively new area of design, but already there have been standout projects.
Across all of our media, the QR code (or Quick Response code) is
increasingly a symbol of interactive potential. Scanning a QR code with an
enabled device such as a smartphone brings up a website, a video, an
application, or other information. A 2009 building in Japan broke new ground
by building interactivity into its surface (fig. 11.15). Scanning the QR codes
on the façade will show information about the building’s hours of operation,
sales that are taking place in the stores inside, and even recent tweets by users
who walk its hallways. The designers of the building created an alternative to
billboards; instead of pushing content on everyone as most outdoor displays
do, the information in the N Building is accessible only if a consumer “asks”
by activating its QR codes.

Websites are still a major source of information for all of us, and a well-
designed site can make gathering information pleasurable. The website about
the movie The Sonic Sea (fig. 11.16) presents information about the movie
and the recently recognized problem of noise in the ocean. Slow-moving
graphics and an overall blue color scheme make the site peaceful; voiceovers
play out over background sounds of waves. Scrolling down in the learning
section of the site brings well-proportioned words and text, along with
clickable links to more information about how to take action. All of this
information unfolds clearly, without overloading the user.

The smartphone app INKS (fig. 11.17) is an interactive game based on
pinball but with an artistic component. Viewers shoot virtual pinballs that hit
colored edge areas to release flowing digital paint that can be controlled. The
colors flow and blend according to the speed of the ball and the degree of tilt
that the user applies to the device. The ball takes on the color that it most
recently struck, leaving a curving trail and adding a design element. The app

Industrial Product Design
We all handle designed products every day, and industrial designers work to
make these products more beautiful, useful, and sustainable. We close this
chapter by examining objects that have made history by integrating utility,
technology, and cutting-edge design.
All handheld media devices, such as tablets and smartphones, have their
origins in the transistor radio, which was first made practical by the Sony
Corporation in 1957 (fig. 11.18). This new radio, the TR-610, fitted in the
hand and had a small speaker and a built-in antenna. Buyers could also select
the exterior color. A large loop at the back was extendable for setting the
device on a table. During its two years of shelf life, this model sold more than
two million units.

610 transistor radio. 1957.

The name Sony was itself invented near the time of the release of the TR-
610, in order to facilitate global sales. A custom-designed word, it was not
tied to any nationality and was easy to read and say in many languages. In the
1970s, the company united miniature headphones with the new cassette
technology and invented the Walkman. When compact-disc recordings
became feasible in the 1980s, Sony developed a portable player, and the
advent of computer-based digital audio at the beginning of the twenty-first
century led to a proliferation of mp3 players.

The advent of lithium ion batteries in the new millennium broadened the uses
of electricity for powering many kinds of devices, among them motorcycles
such as the BMW Concept e Scooter (fig. 11.19). The new electric motor in
turn enabled new design solutions for two-wheeled transport. The first thing
we may notice about this model is the lack of a gas tank and tailpipe. The
structural elements in the design seem to lean forward, suggesting speed. And
indeed, this model accelerates more quickly than a gasoline-powered
motorcycle of similar size. It also runs nearly silently while producing zero
emissions. This is one of many examples of products that designers are
creating to help encourage green thinking.

A chair is a mundane device for sitting, but recently Andrew Jones rethought
its parameters and came up with the Battery Chair (fig. 11.20). The overall
shape suggests a flower, and the blue color refers to the blooms of the scilla
plant, which flourishes locally in the northeastern United States. The
lightweight stackable design and cartoony, flower-petal shape of the chair
suggests informality and relaxation. This is appropriate because Jones
designed it for the National Park Service to install in the grassy Battery Park
at the southern tip of Manhattan, which also hosts an outdoor market,
concerts, and movie screenings. The park service commissioned the chair
from Jones after an open competition for a new chair design that drew 679
entries from around the world. Committees and the general public assessed
and sifted the entries in a process that included sitting in prototypes to check
comfort; they found that the Battery Chair encourages a relaxed posture and
judged this entry the best for the setting.

As we have seen, we encounter graphic design and related design disciplines
frequently in our daily lives. Design is a creative process that employs art and
technology to produce visual compositions and objects that can attract,
inform, persuade, delight, and assist us.

Most viewers who approach Martin Puryear’s work C.F.A.O. (fig. 12.1,
opposite left) will first see a dizzying welter of wood pieces, stacked in a
loose network and glued together, atop an old wheelbarrow. Mostly
unpainted, the stack of pieces seems to have a rectilinear organization, but it
is too dense to see through. It is also, at 8 feet 5 inches, rather tall. It looks as
if someone may have thought of a unique way to bring home the day’s
purchases from the lumber yard.

But if we walk around it and look from the other side (fig. 12.1, opposite
right), we see the reason for the apparent density of the work: a large, curving
shape, based on an elongated African mask, that the artist painted white.
Clearly, in order to see and grasp this work, we must walk around it and
examine it from various angles.

Methods and Materials
Most sculpture is made by modeling, casting, carving, constructing, and
assembling, or a combination of these processes.
Modeling
Modeling is usually an additive process. Artists work with their hands to
model pliable material such as clay, wax, or plaster. They build up, remove,
or push the material into a final form.
Cultures around the world have left us examples of their arts through
modeled ceramics. Tool marks and fingerprint impressions are visible on the
surface as evidence of the modeling technique employed to make Ballplayer
with Three-Part Yoke and Bird Headdress (fig. 12.5). Body volume, natural
gesture, and costume detail are clearly defined. The ancient Maya, who lived
in what are now parts of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, used clay to
create fine ceramic vessels and lively sculptures. This player wears a bright
blue headdress that the sculptor added to the figure before firing. He also
wears a wide yoke around his waist for protection, and wristbands and
anklets for hitting the ball, because use of the hands was not allowed.

The working consistencies of clay, wax, and plaster are soft. To prevent
sagging, sculptors usually start all but very small pieces with a rigid inner
support called an armature. When clay is modeled to form large sculptures,
the total piece can be built in relatively small, separately fired, structurally
self-sufficient sections, thereby eliminating the need for an armature.
Auguste Rodin used a small armature to hold the plaster up as he worked on
Naked Balzac (fig. 12.6). He created the sculpture by gradually adding
plaster, working up from below; when the plaster dried, he removed the
armature. Balzac was a well-known French author, and a literary society had
commissioned Rodin to make an honorary statue. In preparation, the artist
studied Balzac’s novels and essays for several months. Rodin thought the
nudity and decisively striding pose effectively captured Balzac’s personality.
When he presented this sculpture the society rejected it, so the artist kept it in
his studio.

Artworks made through modeling need not be representational, as Ken
Price’s Vink (fig. 12.7) shows. He modeled this work out of clay, fired it,
painted it with multiple layers of acrylic paint, and then sanded the surface to
expose spots of the paint layers below. Although the title refers to a small
European songbird, any resemblance is coincidental. Rather, this piece
suggests body parts, undersea organisms yet undiscovered, or some kind of
knobby plant life. The iridescent color adds to the mysteriousness of the
shape.

Casting
Casting is a way of making three-dimensional works by pouring a liquid into
a mold and allowing it to harden before removing the mold. This process
makes it possible to execute a work in an easily handled medium (such as
clay) and then to reproduce the results in a more permanent material (such as
bronze). Because most casting involves the substitution of one material for
another, casting is also called a substitution process. The process of bronze
casting was highly developed in ancient China, Greece, Rome, and parts of
Africa. It has been used extensively in the West for the last five centuries, and
is the most common medium for memorial statues in public parks.
Casting requires several steps. First, a mold is made from the original work.
The process of making the mold varies, depending on the material of the
original and the material used in the casting. Materials that will harden can be
used to make molds: clay, concrete, or a liquid plastic such as fiberglass.
Whatever the material, the mold completely surrounds the original, leaving
no gaps. Second, the original sculpture is removed from the mold; this may
require disassembly of either the original or the mold. Next, the casting liquid
(most often molten bronze) is poured into the resulting hollow cavity of the
mold. Finally, when the casting liquid has hardened, the mold is removed.
Some casting processes use molds or flexible materials that allow many casts
to be made from the same mold. One of these is the lost-wax process (fig.
12.8), one of several processes that preserve the mold for possible later use.
In some other methods the mold must be destroyed to remove the hardened
cast, thus permitting the creation of only a single cast.

12.8 The Lost-Wax Casting
Process.
Figure 12.8 Full Alternative Text
Castings can be solid or hollow, depending on the casting method. The cost

and the weight of the material often help to determine which casting method
will be used for a specific work. The Statue of Liberty in New York harbor,
for example, was cast in many pieces and reassembled into a hollow whole
on site; an elaborate armature holds it up.
The process of casting a large object such as a bronze memorial statue can be
extremely complicated. Except for small pieces that can be cast solid, most
artists turn their originals over to foundry experts, who make the molds and
do the casting. Most of our monuments in public parks were cast in bronze
from artists’ clay or wax models. Robert Longo’s Corporate Wars: Wall of
Influence (see fig. 12.4) is made from cast aluminum.
Many items are cast besides artworks, such as automobile engine parts, some
dishes, and children’s toys. Charles Ray made witty reference to the latter in
his cast-steel work Father Figure (fig. 12.9). He based it on a green plastic
toy tractor, which he enlarged to life-size in a plaster model before casting it
in solid steel. The work weighs more than 18 tons, and its original toylike
nature has vanished as the “father figure” looms, faintly menacing, at one
with his machinery.

Duane Hanson, in contrast, cast actual people from life, using friends and
relatives as models (fig. 12.10). After shaving all body hair, the models posed
and were cast in segments applying silicone rubber directly onto their skin.
After the rubber coating hardened, Hanson cut it away from the model and
filled it with either polyester resin or auto body filler. He then painted the
skin tones and added human hair before clothing them. Because the mold was
ruined in the removal, the artist made only unique casts. As we see in Man
with Camera, his models were generally posed in everyday postures and
unremarkable clothing, which gave his sculpture a jolt of realism.

English artist Rachel Whiteread also uses new materials such as polyvinyl
resin in fascinating cast pieces that turn empty spaces into solid volumes. To
create Untitled (Hive) I (fig. 12.11), she filled a beehive with lustrous brown-
orange resin and then took away the hive to leave only the interior, now
rendered solid. In casting, artists make use of absence and presence, replacing
one substance with another. By casting empty volumes, Whiteread gives
absence a new kind of haunting presence.

Carving

Carving away unwanted material to form a sculpture is a subtractive process.
Michelangelo preferred this method. Close observation of his chisel marks on
the surfaces of the unfinished Awakening Slave (fig. 12.12) reveals the steps
he took toward increasingly refined cutting, even before he had roughed out
the figure from all sides. Because Michelangelo left this piece in an
unfinished state, it seems as though we are looking over his shoulder midway
through the carving process. For him, making sculpture was a process of
releasing the form from within the block of stone. This is one of four figures,
later called Slaves, that he abandoned in various stages of completion.

Carving is the most challenging of the three basic sculptural methods because
it is a one-way process that provides little or no opportunity to correct errors.
Before beginning to cut, the sculptor must visualize the finished form from
every angle within the original block of material. (Another example of
Michelangelo’s carving is his Pietà; see fig. 4.21.)
The various types of stone with their different characteristics greatly
influence the kind of carving that can be done with them. The marble that
Michelangelo and many sculptors in the European tradition prefer is typically
soft and workable enough that it can be cut with a chisel. Final polishing with
a light abrasive yields a smooth and creamy surface not unlike human skin.
Marble has been a preferred material in the West for outdoor sculpture for
centuries, but modern air pollution and acid rain harm the stone, making it far
less desirable today. Granite avoids these pitfalls, and thus is often used for
outdoor monuments such as tombstones, but it is so hard that carving in detail
is difficult. Sandstone and limestone are sedimentary materials that have also
found wide use in many parts of the world. The Cambodian creators of Army
on the March (see fig. 12.3) took advantage of the fine-grained qualities of
sandstone when carving the intricate background foliage. Sedimentary stones
are relatively soft, allowing much detail, and can be polished to a high gloss,
although weather reduces this over time.

The ancient Egyptians used schist, a dense stone similar to slate. The jade
that the Chinese favored is so hard and brittle that it can be ground down only
by abrasion or filing; hence it is suitable only for small pieces. The disk, or bi
(fig. 12.13), found in a Chinese royal tomb, is an exquisite example of
carving using pale green nephrite, a rare type of jade. Chinese workers
ground the stone nearly 2,000 years ago, using drills and quartz sand in a
highly laborious process. The results of their work in this piece show a rare
order of quality; the raised circles in the disk (called bosses) line up in
perfectly even rows, and the feline monster above shows a rounded body and

graceful, cat-like movement, amid a pattern that suggests clouds and wind.
In wood carving, many sculptors prefer walnut and cypress because they
combine strength and ease of working. The process begins with a block of
wood, which the artist may draw on to help visualize the design. Carving is
done with a variety of tools, such as gouges and chisels, subtracting material
until the final form is reached. In Elizabeth Catlett’s carved Mother and Child
#2 (fig. 12.14), the gesture of the mother suggests anguish, perhaps over the
struggles all mothers know each child will face. Both figures have been
abstracted in a composition of bold sweeping curves and essential shapes.
Solidity of the mass is relieved by the open space between the uplifted chin
and raised elbow and by the convex and concave surfaces. An engraved line
indicating the mother’s right hand accents the surface of the form. The
smooth, highly polished wood invites the viewer to touch.

Constructing and Assembling
For most of recorded history, the major sculpting techniques in the Western
world were modeling, carving, and casting. Early in the twentieth century,
assembling methods became popular. When artists put together pieces that
they have shaped themselves, the result is called a construction. Sculpture
built from found objects is called assemblage.
In the late 1920s, Spaniard Julio González pioneered the use of the welding
torch for cutting and welding metal sculpture. The invention of oxyacetylene
welding in 1895 had provided the necessary tool for welded metal sculpture,
but it took three decades for artists to use the new tool’s potential. González
had learned welding while working briefly in an automobile factory. After
several decades—and limited success—as a painter, he began assisting
Picasso with the construction of metal sculpture. Subsequently, González
committed himself to sculpture and began to create constructions. In 1932 he
wrote:
The Age of Iron began many centuries ago by producing very beautiful
objects, unfortunately mostly weapons. Today it makes possible bridges
and railroads as well. It is time that this material cease to be a murderer
and the simple instrument of an overly mechanical science. The door is
wide open, at last! for this material to be forged and hammered by the
peaceful hands of artists.1
González welded flexed iron rods to create his construction Maternity (fig.
12.15). It is airy and playful as it suggests a feminine anatomy atop a stone
base.

Phyllida Barlow uses carpentry techniques to create aggressively ungainly
constructions that fill galleries to the point of obstruction. Her recent work
untitled:stiltedcrates2015 (fig. 12.16) at first seems dangerous to approach,
as it consists of large wooden crates that she built, perched on pieces of
lumber. The work delivers a visual jolt to viewers, who wonder how the
teetering piece came into its present form. The disorder is apparent, however,
only because Barlow carefully engineers her works for safety.

Some sculptors assemble found objects in ways that radically change the way
we see familiar things. Yet we see enough of the objects’ original
characteristics that we can participate in their transformation. Such work
requires metaphorical visual thinking by both artists and viewers.
Marc André Robinson shops in thrift stores for pieces of old used furniture
and assembles new objects from them. Throne for the Greatest Rapper of All
Time (fig. 12.17) is one such assemblage. We see at the lower center that the
piece is based on found chairs, but he added a higher back and wings to the
sides. If the purpose of a throne is to dignify whoever sits in it, this
assemblage accomplishes that. This throne is a higher form of chair, made
mostly from chairs.

Martin Puryear manipulates and shapes wood in several different ways. In
C.F.A.O. (see fig. 12.1), he combined carving with construction in a work
that includes a found wheelbarrow. His pieces also often involve carving,
constructing, and then finishing the work into a finely crafted shape (see
Martin Puryear: Constructing Possibilities, opposite).
CREATORS
Martin Puryear: Constructing Possibilities
Why become a sculptor? Martin Puryear (b. 1941) said, “The difference is so
great when you go into the third dimension.... It’s not simply a two-
dimensional thing expanded. It’s like an infinitely multiple view, an infinitely
multiplied sense of possibilities, spatial possibilities. That’s what interests
me.”2
The son of a self-taught woodworker, Puryear grew up attending segregated
schools in Washington, D.C. He recalled an early electrifying experience that
turned his mind toward art: “I was lucky enough as a really little kid to see a
guy painting a portrait on my block, a black guy painting in oils a portrait of
somebody right out on the street. And I was just transfixed to see in it an
absolute likeness. I remember it was like grisaille [gray], it was black and
white, it was like monochromatic.... I couldn’t have been more than 6 years

old, but I just couldn’t believe it, it just . . . and it was a black guy, painting
another black person, with his easel and paints and everything and a palette,
right in front of the apartment. And it just blew something open in me.”3
Puryear studied art at the Catholic University of America, before serving in
the Peace Corps for two years in Sierra Leone. Here he came to admire the
woodworkers he met for their resourcefulness and skill as they handcrafted
objects for daily use. It seemed to him that many of the crafted objects that he
saw in Africa seemed like works of art, although their makers regarded them
only as tools. Puryear then attended the Swedish Royal Academy of Art in
Stockholm, where he studied printmaking. He also apprenticed himself in the
private studio of a master woodworker.
Respect for craft has characterized Puryear’s art ever since. We see this in the
wood construction Hominid (fig. 12.18). A hominid is a pre-human primate,
halfway between chimp and person. The work is an irregular polygonal block
on wooden rollers that stands more than 6 feet tall. We may well imagine
hominids pushing this piece along on its rollers, for reasons that remain
mysterious. Puryear finished the block using all the cabinet maker’s
traditional skills of sawing, joining, and finishing, but these only add to its
enigmatic quality. In titling a work, Puryear tries to “juxtapose things in order
to open up various possible meanings to the imagination.”4 In Hominid, as in
many of his other works, his creation shows obvious craftsmanship, but its
meaning is only suggested to the viewer.

Puryear prefers to leave any symbolism for the viewer to determine. His work
does not generally allow easy correspondence between imagery and meaning.
Rather, he creates his work to only suggest shapes, which viewers will then
complete in their minds. Some of his pieces may suggest various possible
meanings through their shapes, but the artist regards such ambiguity as added
interest. His thought process as he creates involves managing and distilling
those possible meanings.
Puryear’s sculptures create an absorbing mix of possibilities in the mind. The
time that it takes for viewers to sense, and then weigh possible meanings is
the key moment for appreciating his work. He says, “I think my work speaks
to anybody who has the capacity to slow down.”5

Kinetic Sculpture
Alexander Calder was among the first to explore the possibilities of kinetic
sculpture, or sculpture that moves. Sculptors’ traditional focus on mass is
replaced in Calder’s work by a focus on shape, space, and movement. Works
such as his huge Untitled (see fig. 3.33) at the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C., are often called mobiles because the suspended parts
move in response to small air currents.
If Calder’s mobiles are massive and exuberant, far more delicate are the
mobiles of Jesús Rafael Soto, such as Escritura Hurtado (fig. 12.19). Against
a background of painted, thin vertical stripes, suspended curves of wire
slowly sway in whatever air currents are present. These wire pieces resemble
the strokes of handwriting; hence the title. Their motion makes the
background seem to vibrate.

Some kinetic works move under human-made power rather than breezes.
Jean Tinguely used electricity to power his large work Méta-Harmonie II
(fig. 12.20). Viewers activate the work with the foot pedal on the floor; this
starts the many rotors whirring slowly. They in turn hit gongs and drums, rub
against abrasive surfaces, and even bang on the piano to create a cacophony
of sound. Most kinetic works need to be experienced in motion; this one
should be heard as well. Several viewers who have seen this work in action
have uploaded videos of it to sharing sites.

Mixed Media
Today’s artists frequently use a variety of media in a single work. Such
works may be labeled with a long list of materials, or they may be identified
only as mixed media. If a mixed media work includes only found objects, the
work may also be called an assemblage. A mixed media work may include
two- or three-dimensional elements, or a mixture. Often, the choice of media
expresses some cultural or symbolic meaning.
The contemporary Chinese-born artist Cai Guo-Qiang created a huge and
symbolic mixed media piece in 2004 with Inopportune: Stage One (fig.
12.21), now in the Seattle Art Museum. The work consists of nine
automobiles perforated by light tubes. The cars are arrayed as if we are seeing
momentary glimpses of one car flipping through the air as it explodes. Cai
intended this work to refer both to contemporary action movies (where cars
often explode and fly through the air) and to car bombings by terrorists. The
work challenges us to consider if this is a thrilling scene, as in a movie, or a
horrendous one, as in real life.

When Lara Schnitger drapes and stretches fabric over wooden armatures, she
creates both a sculpture and a hollow interior space. The work of this Los
Angeles-based artist straddles the boundary between sculpture and fashion
design, just as the figures she creates hover nervously between human and
some other living thing. In Grim Boy (fig. 12.22), for example, she used
various dark-colored fabrics together with beads and fur to suggest a
mannequin from hell. This tense, lurking figure seems to exude the nervous
energy of an adolescent combined with the quick eye of a bird. But it stands
almost 6 feet tall, like a gangling teenager, and the work’s title may remind us
of a brooding, trenchcoat-clad youth. There is an additional feminist message
to most of Schnitger’s work as well, because she is doing a sort of
“dressmaking,” a traditional women’s artform. Rather than creating beautiful
adornments, though, she fashions curious quasi-human beings.

Nick Cave frequently creates three-dimensional works using an extremely
wide variety of media. His 2013 work titled simply Sculpture (fig. 12.23)
includes an antique couch, a ceramic dog, metal flowers, and a light fixture,
among other things. This work has a strong element of fantasy, as if the open-
eyed dog is dreaming of a lush garden. The artist, who is not related to the
Australian rock musician of the same name, does a lot of shopping at thrift
stores and home-furnishing outlets. He may keep an object for years until, as
he put it, “it finds its way into my work.” He said that he wants to counteract
a natural tendency humans have “to want to categorize things,” so he creates
sculptures in which recognizable things come into unfamiliar juxtapositions.
He said of his work, “There’s a sort of humanness to it, but yet it’s not of this
world.”6

Installation and Site-Specific Art
Many artists now use the three-dimensional medium of installation to make
their visual statements. In an installation, the artist treats an entire space as an
artwork and transforms it.
Rafael Lozano-Hemmer used all of the walls in a gallery for his interactive
installation Airborne (fig. 12.24). He projected regularly changing texts from
news stories onto the walls. As viewers passed before them, they cast
shadows that blocked the texts; standing farther away from the wall yielded a
larger shadow. Many viewers danced or walked or pantomimed, making their
moving shadows part of the news story. If viewers remained stationary, heat
rising from their bodies took on a smoky appearance in the shadow, which
further distorted and erased the news items on the walls behind. The
installation afforded viewers a new and entertaining way to interact with the
news of the day.

Airborne has been installed in several locations as a temporary exhibition, but
some installations are intended only for particular locations. Such works are

called site-specific.
The best-known work of site-specific art in the United States became famous
because of a lawsuit that tested the limits of the artist’s power. In 1981, the
government installed Richard Serra’s large work Tilted Arc (fig. 12.25) in the
plaza adjoining a federal office building in New York City; it was a tilting,
curving blade of steel 12 feet high. Soon the office workers began to
complain about it: it blocked the view; it forced them to walk a detour around
it; it became a homeless shelter; it collected graffiti. When the government
announced plans to relocate the work, the artist filed a lawsuit, claiming that
Tilted Arc was meant for that spot, and to relocate it would be to destroy it.
The artist lost his case, but the matter did not turn on any legal requirement of
site-specificity; rather, the court held that the government, as owner of the
work, could dispose of it. After years of court cases, Tilted Arc was removed
in 1989.

In 2016, Olafur Eliasson created a stunning site-specific work for the gardens
of Versailles outside Paris. Waterfall (fig. 12.26) is a huge cascade that from

some angles appears to emerge out of nowhere. This work is an extreme
version of the waterfalls and fountains that have graced that formerly royal
property since the sixteenth century. A metal scaffold and accompanying
pumps carry the water from the lake to a height that the artist refused to
divulge. He felt that keeping the height a secret helps to preserve the dramatic
impact.

Key Terms
additive sculpture
– sculptural form produced by adding, combining, or building up
material from a core or (in some cases) an armature
armature
– a rigid framework serving as a supporting inner core for clay or other
soft sculpting material
assemblage
– sculpture made by assembling found or cast-off objects
bas relief (also called low relief)
– sculpture in relief in which the subjects emerge only slightly from the

surface; no undercutting is present
boss
– a circular, often dome-shaped, decoration that protrudes from a flat
surface
carving
– a subtractive process in which a sculpture is formed by removing
material from a block or mass of wood, stone, or other material, with the
use of sharpened tools
casting
– a process that involves pouring liquid material such as molten metal,
clay, wax, or plaster into a mold; when the liquid hardens, the mold is
removed, and a form in the shape of the mold is left
construction
– creating a work of sculpture by putting together pieces that are already
formed by the artist
freestanding
– any piece or type of sculpture that is meant to be seen from all sides
high relief
– sculpture in relief in which more than half of a significant portion of
the subject emerges from the background; high-relief sculpture thus
requires undercutting, in contrast to low relief
installation
– an art medium in which the artist arranges objects or artworks in a
room, thinking of the entire space as the medium to be manipulated

kinetic sculpture
– sculpture that incorporates actual movement as part of the design
lost wax
– a casting method: First a model is made from wax and encased in clay
or casting plaster; when the clay is fired to make a mold, the wax melts
away, leaving a void that can be filled with molten metal or other self-
hardening liquid to produce a cast
low relief (also called bas relief)
– sculpture in relief in which the subjects emerge only slightly from the
surface; no undercutting is present
mixed media
– works of art made with more than one medium
mobile
– a type of sculpture in which parts move, usually suspended parts
activated by air currents
modeling
– working pliable material such as clay or wax into three-dimensional
forms
mold
– a cavity usually created out of plaster, clay, or plastic for use in casting
relief
– sculpture in which three-dimensional forms project from the flat
background of which they are a part

site-specific
– any work made for a certain place, which cannot be separated or
exhibited apart from its intended environment
substitution
– the process of making a work of art by casting, as opposed to additive
or subtractive processes
subtractive sculpture
– sculpture made by removing material from a larger block or form

Objects
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. 13.1 Identify the three general categories of clay and describe their
characteristics.
2. 13.2 Discuss some of the techniques used by artists working with glass.
3. 13.3 Describe metalworking techniques used in the creation of
functional objects.
4. 13.4 Identify crafting techniques associated with wood.
5. 13.5 Describe three traditional methods used in textile works.
William Morris’s Windrush (fig. 13.1) is an elegant and well-crafted
woodblock print that fulfills a commonplace function with artistry. A design
in several colors that is repeatable, it can serve as either a textile or a
wallpaper pattern. Covering your table or your bedroom wall with Windrush
can enrich your surroundings, so that it may seem as if you are living with an
artwork.
