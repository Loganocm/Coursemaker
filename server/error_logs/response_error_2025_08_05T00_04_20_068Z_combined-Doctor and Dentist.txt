  "notes": "## Chapter: Doctor and Dentist\n\nThis chapter explores the contrasting experiences with medical and dental care in a historical context, focusing on Dr. Helmcken, the family doctor, and an unnamed, rough dentist in Victoria.\n\n### I. Dr. Helmcken: The Family Doctor\n\n*   **Role and Demeanor:**\n    *   **General Practitioner:** Dr. Helmcken served as the community's family doctor.
    *   **Quick Response:** Known for his prompt arrival and dedication, even during challenging weather like a storm.
    *   **Cheerful Disposition:** Despite the nature of his work, he maintained a cheerful and reassuring presence.
    *   **'Horrible' Medicines:** His treatments involved medicines that were perceived as unpleasant or 'horrible,' reflecting the medical practices of the era.\n*   **Dedication and Bond:**\n    *   **Bond with Julia:** He had a strong bond with his mare, Julia, who was essential for his house calls.
    *   **Storm Dedication:** His commitment to his patients was evident as he braved a storm to attend to them.\n*   **Medical Skills and Community Involvement:**\n    *   **Skilled Practitioner:** Demonstrated his medical prowess, such as successfully treating his brother's leg.
    *   **Community Figure:** Active in community events and emergencies, exemplified by his involvement during a fire.\n*   **Patient Experience (Small):**\n    *   **Needle in the Knee:** Small's painful experience of having a needle in her knee highlights the lack of sophisticated pain management.
    *   **Lack of Anesthesia:** A significant detail emphasizing that painful procedures were performed without anesthesia, a common practice for the time.\n*   **Office and Examination Style:**\n    *   **Unique Office:** His office had a distinct character.
    *   **Unconventional Examination:** He had a unique and perhaps informal examination style.\n\n### II. Victoria's Dentist\n\n*   **Character and Practices:**\n    *   **Contrasting Character:** Stood in stark contrast to Dr. Helmcken, known for his unpleasant demeanor.
    *   **'Shamming':** Implies he was deceptive or feigned interest/skill, possibly to avoid difficult work or to overcharge.
    *   **Rough Extractions:** His dental procedures, particularly extractions, were described as rough and brutal.\n*   **Patient Experience (Small):**\n    *   **Painful Encounters:** Small endured highly painful and distressing experiences during her visits.
    *   **Physical Discipline:** The dentist resorted to physically slapping Small during a procedure, indicating a lack of empathy and professional conduct.
    *   **Bribes:** He attempted to bribe Small to quiet her cries, further illustrating his unprofessional and unsympathetic approach.\n*   **Small's Defiance:**\n    *   **'Royal Beast':** In an act of defiance and a reflection of her trauma, Small secretly named the dentist 'Royal Beast,' capturing her perception of him as cruel and authoritative.",
