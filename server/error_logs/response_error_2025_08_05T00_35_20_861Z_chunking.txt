      "content": "All our Sundays were exactly alike. They began on Saturday night\nafter Bong the Chinaboy had washed up and gone away, after our\ntoys, dolls and books, all butThe Peep of Dayand Bunyan’sPilgrim’s\nProgress, had been stored away in drawers and boxes till Monday,\nand every Bible and prayerbook in the house was puffing itself out,\nlooking more important every minute.\nThen the clothes-horse came galloping into the kitchen and\nstraddled round the stove inviting our clean clothes to mount and\nbe aired. The enormous wooden tub that looked half coffin and\nhalf baby-bath was set in the middle of the kitchen floor with a\nrag mat for dripping on laid close beside it. The great iron soup\npot, the copper wash-boiler and several kettles covered the top of\nthe stove, and big sister Dede filled them by working the kitchen\npump-handle furiously. I t was a sad old pump and always groaned\nseveral times before it poured. Dede got the brown Windsor soap,\nheated the towels and put on a thick white apron with a bib. Mother\nunbuttoned us and by that time the pots and kettles were steaming.\nDede scrubbed hard. If you wriggled, the flat of the long-handled\ntin dipper came down spankety on your skin.\nAs soon as each child was bathed Dede took it pick-a-back and\nrushed it upstairs through the cold house. We were allowed to\nsay our prayers kneeling in bed on Saturday night, steamy, brown-\nwindsory prayers—then we cuddled down and tumbled very\ncomfortably into Sunday.\nAt seven o’clock Father stood beside our bed and said, “Rise up!\nRise up! It’s Sunday, children.” He need not have told us; we knew\nFather’s Sunday smell—Wright’s coal-tar soap and camphor. Father\nhad a splendid chest of camphor-wood which had come from\nEngland round the Horn in a sailing-ship with him. His clean clothes\nlived in it and on Sunday he was very camphory. The chest was high\nand very heavy. I t had brass handles and wooden knobs. The top let\ndown as a writing desk with pigeon-holes; below there were little\ndrawers for handkerchiefs and collars and long drawers for clothes.\nOn top of the chest stood Father’s locked desk for papers. The key of\nit was on his ring with lots of others. This desk had a secret drawer\nand a brass plate with R. H. CARR engraved on it.\nOn top of the top desk stood the little Dutchman, a china figure\nwith a head that took off and a stomach full of little candies like\ncoloured hailstones. If we had been very good all week we got\nhailstones Sunday morning.\nFamily prayers were uppish with big words on Sunday—reverend\nawe-ful words that only God and Father understood.\nNo work was done in the Carr house on Sunday. Everything had\nbeen polished frightfully on Saturday and all Sunday’s food cooked\ntoo. On Sunday morning Bong milked the cow and went away from\nbreakfast until evening milking-time. Beds were made, the dinner-\ntable set, and then we got into our very starchiest and most\nuncomfortable clothes for church.\nOur family had a big gap in the middle of i t where William, John\nand Thomas had all been born and died in quick succession, which\nleft a wide space between Dede and Tallie and the four younger\nchildren.\nLizzie, Alice and I were always dressed exactly alike. Father\nwanted my two big sisters to dress the same, but they rebelled, and\nMother stood behind them. Father thought we looked like orphans\nif we were clothed differently. The Orphans sat in front of us at\nchurch. No two of them had anything alike. People gave them all\nthe things their own children had grown out of—some of them were\nvery strange in shape and colour.\nWhen we were all dressed, we went to Mother’s room to be looked\nover. Mother was very delicate and could not get up early or walk\nthe two miles to church, and neither could Tallie or little Dick.\nFather went to Dr. Reid’s Presbyterian Church at the corner of\nPandora and Blanshard streets. Father was not particularly\nPresbyterian, but he was a little deaf and he liked Dr. Reid because,\nif we sat at the top of the church, he could hear his sermons. There\nwas just the Orphans in front of us, and the stove in front of them.\nThe heat of the stove sent them all to sleep. But Dr. Reid was a kind\npreacher—he did not bang the Bible, nor shout to wake them up.\nSometimes I went to sleep too, but I tried not to because of what\nhappened at home after Sunday’s dinner.\nIf the road had not been so crooked it would have been a straight\nline from the gate of our lily field to the church door. We did not\nhave to turn a single corner. Lizzie, Alice and I walked in the middle\nof the road and took hands. Dede was on one end of us and Father\non the other. Dede carried a parasol, and Father, a fat yellow stick,\nnot a flourish stick but one to walk with. If we met anything, we\ndangled in a row behind Father like the tail of a kite.\nWe were always very early for church and could watch the\nOrphans march in. The Matron arranged every bad Orphan between\ntwo good ones, and put very little ones beside big ones, then she\nset herself down behind them where she could watch and poke any\nOrphan that needed it. She was glad when the stove sent them all to\nsleep and did not poke unless an Orphan had adenoids and snored.\nThe minute the church bell stopped a little door in front of the\nOrphans opened, and Dr. Reid came out and somebody behind him\nshut the door, which was rounded at the top and had a reverend\nshut.\nDr. Reid had very shiny eyes and very red lips. He wore a black\ngown with two little white tabs like the tail of a bird sticking out\nfrom under his beard. He carried a roll in his hand like Moses, and on\nit were all the things that he was going to say to us. He walked slowly\nbetween the Orphans and the stove and climbed into the pulpit and\nprayed. The S’s sizzled in his mouth as if they were frying. He was\na very nice minister and the only parson that Father ever asked to\ndinner.\nThe moment Dr. Reid amened, we rushed straight out of the\nchurch off home. Father said it was very bad taste for people to\nstand gabbing at church doors. We came down Church Hill, past the\nConvent Garden, up Marvin’s Hill, through the wild part of Beacon\nHill Park into our own gate. The only time we stopped was to gather\nsome catnip to take home to the cats, and the only turn we made\nwas into our own gate.\nOur Sunday dinner was cold saddle of mutton. It was roasted on\nSaturday in a big tin oven on legs, which was pushed up to the\nopen grate fire in the breakfast-room. Father had this fire-place\nspecially built just like the ones in England. The oven fitted right up\nto it. He thought everything English was much better than anything\nCanadian. The oven came round the Horn with him, and the big\npewter hot-water dishes that he ate his chops and steaks off, and\nthe heavy mahogany furniture and lots of other things that you\ncould not buy in Canada then. The tin oven had a jack which you\nwound up like a clock and it turned the roast on a spit. It said ‘tick,\ntick, tick’ and turned the meat one way, and then ‘tock, tock, tock’\nand turned it the other. The meat sizzled and sputtered. Someone\nwas always opening the little tin door in the back to baste it, using a\nlong iron spoon, with the dripping that was caught in a pan beneath\nthe meat. Father said no roast under twenty pounds was worth\neating because the juice had all run out of i t, so it was lucky he had\na big family.\nRed currant jelly was served with the cold mutton, and potato\nsalad and pickled cabbage, afterwards there was deep apple pie\nwith lots of Devonshire cream. In the centre of the dinner-table,\njust below the cruet stand, stood an enormous loaf of bread. Mr.\nHarding, the baker, cooked one for Father every Saturday. I t was\nfour loaves baked in one so that i t did not get as stale as four small\nloaves would have. It was made cottage-loaf-shape—two storeys\nhigh with a dimple in the top.\nWhen dinner was finished, Father folded his napkin very straight,\nhe even slipped his long fingers inside each fold again after it was\nin the ring, for Father always wanted everything straight and right.\nThen he looked up one side of the table and down the other. We\nall tried not to squirm because he always picked the squirmiest.\nWhen he had decided who should start, he said, “Tell me what you\nremember of the sermon.”\nIf Dede was asked first, she “here and there’d” all over the sermon.\nIf i t was Lizzie, she plowed steadily through from text to amen. Alice\nalways remembered the text. Sometimes I remembered one of Dr.\nReid’s jokes, that is if I was asked first—if not I usually said, “The\nothers have told it all, Father,” and was dreadfully uncomfortable\nwhen Father said, “Very well; repeat it, then.”\nWhen we had done everything we could with Dr. Reid’s sermon,\nFather went into the sitting-room to take his Sunday nap, Mother\nread, and Dede took hold of our religion.\nShe taught Sunday School in Bishop Cridge’s house, to a huge\nfamily of Balls and an enormous family of Fawcetts, a smarty boy\ncalled Eddy, a few other children who came and went, and us. The\nBishop’s invalid sister sat in the room all the time. Her cheeks were\nhollow, she had sharp eyes with red rims, sat by the fire, wore a cap\nand coughed, not because she had to, but just to remind us that she\nwas watching and listening.\nFrom dinner till it was time to go to the Bishop’s, we learned\ncollects, texts and hymns. Dede was shamed because the Balls, the\nFawcetts and all the others did better than I who was her own sister.\nYou got a little text-card when you knew your lessons. When you\nhad six little cards you had earned a big text-card. I hardly ever got a\nlittle card and always lost it on the way home, so that I never earned\na big one. I could sing much better than Addie Ball who just talked\nthe hymns out very loud, but Dede only told me not to shout and let\nAddie groan away without any tune at all.\nWhen Dede marched us home, Father was ready, and Mother had\nher hat on, to start for the Sunday walk around our place. Dede\nstayed home to get the tea, but first she played very loud hymns\non the piano. They followed us all round the fields. Tallie was not\nstrong enough for the walking so she lay on the horsehair sofa in the\ndrawing-room looking very pretty, r esting up for her evening visitor.\nLizzie squeezed out of coming whenever she could because she had\nrather creep into a corner and learn more texts. She had millions\nof texts piled up inside her head just waiting for things to happen,\nthen she pushed the right text over onto them. If you got mad any\ntime after noon, the sun was going to set on your wrath. You could\nfeel the great globe getting hotter and hotter and making your mad\nfiercer because of the way the text stirred it up. If you did not see\nthings just in Lizzie’s way, you were dead in your sins.\nSo the rest of us started for the Sunday walk. We went out the side\ndoor into the garden, through ever so many gates and the cow-yard,\non into a shrubbery which ran round two sides of the cow pasture,\nbut was railed off to keep the cows from destroying the shrubs. A\ntwisty little path ran through the shrubbery. F ather wanted his place\nto look exactly like England. He planted cowslips and primroses and\nhawthorn hedges and all the Englishy flowers. He had stiles and\nmeadows and took away all the wild Canadian-ness and made it as\nmeek and English as he could.\nWe did not take the twisty path but a straight little one of red\nearth, close up under the hedge. We went singly, Father first, then\nMother with little Dick by the hand. Because of William, John and\nThomas being dead, Mother’s only boy was Dick. He had a lovely\nlittle face with blue eyes and yellow curls. He wore a little pant\nsuit with a pleated skirt over the pants which came half-way down\nover his thin little legs. These suits were very fashionable for small\nboys—Mr. Wilson knew that they would sell, because of the jack-\nknife on a knotted cord brought through the buttonhole and\ndropping into a pocket on the chest. When boys saw these knife\nsuits they teased and teased till they got one. Alice plodded along\nbehind Dick, her arms hung loose and floppy. Father thought all\nmake-believes were wicked on Sunday, even make-believe babies,\nso her darling dolls sat staring on the shelf in our bedroom all day. I\ncame last and wished that our Sunday walk was not quite so much\nfenced. First there was the thorny hedge and then the high pickets.\nMr. Green, my friend Edna’s father, took his family to the beach\nevery Sunday. They clattered and chattered past our place having\nsuch jokes. I poked my head through the hedge to whisper,\n“Hello, Edna!”\n“Hello! How dull you do look walking round your own cow-field!\nCome to the beach with us.”\n“I don’t think I can.”\n“Ask your mother.”\nI scraped between Alice and the hedge.\n“Can I Mother?”\n“Your Father likes you to walk with him on Sunday.”\nI stuck my head through the thorns again, and shook it. Once I\nactually asked Father myself if I could go with the Greens, and he\nlooked as hurt as if I’d hit him.\n“Are my nine acres not enough, but you must want to tear over\nthe whole earth? Is the Sabbath a right day to go pleasuring on the\nbeach?” he said.\nBut one Sunday I did go with the Greens. Father had the gout and\ndid not know. We had fun and I got “show-off” from being too happy.\nThe boys dared me to walk a log over the sea, and I fell in. When I\ncame home dripping, Lizzie had a text about my sin finding me out.\nBut I was telling about the family taggling along the path under\nthe hedge. Father’s stick was on the constant poke, pushing a root\ndown or a branch up, or a stone into place, for he was very\nparticular about everything being just right.\nAs we neared the top corner of our big field, that one wild place\nwhere the trees and bushes were allowed to grow thick and tangled,\nand where there was a deep ditch with stinging-nettles about it, and\na rank, muddy smell, Father began to frown and to walk faster and\nfaster till we were crouched down in the path, running after one\nanother like frightened quail. If there were voices on the other side\nof the hedge, we raced like mad.\nThis corner of Father’s property always made him very sore. When\nhe came from England he bought ten acres of fine land adjoining\nBeacon Hill Park which was owned by the City of Victoria. It took\nFather a lot of money to clear his land. He left every fine tree he\ncould, because he loved trees, but he cleared away the scrub to\nmake meadows for the cows, and a beautiful garden. Then he built\nwhat was considered in 1863 a big fine house. It was all made of\nCalifornia redwood. The chimneys were of California brick and the\nmantlepieces of black marble. Every material used in the building of\nFather’s house was the very best, because he never bought anything\ncheap or shoddy. He had to send far away for most of i t, and all the\ntime his family was getting bigger and more expensive, too; so, when\na Mrs. Lush came and asked if he would sell her the corner acre next\nto the Park and farthest away from our house, and as she offered a\ngood price, he sold. But first he said, “Promise me that you will never\nbuild a Public House on the land,” and Mrs. Lush said, “No, Mr. Carr,\nI never will.” But as soon as the land was hers, Mrs. Lush broke her\nword, and put up one of the horridest saloons in Victoria right there.\nFather felt dreadful, but he could not do anything about it, except\nto put up a high fence and coax that part of the hawthorn hedge to\ngrow as tall and be as prickly as it could.\nMrs. Lush’s Public House was called the Park Hotel, but afterwards\nthe name was changed to the Colonist Hotel. It was just a nice drive\nfrom Esquimalt, which was then a Naval Station, and hacks filled\nwith tipsy sailors and noisy ladies drove past our house going to the\nPark Hotel in the daytime and at night. It hurt Father right up till he\nwas seventy years old, when he died.\nAfter we had passed the Park Hotel acre we went slow again so\nthat Father could enjoy his land. We came to the “pickets”, a sort of\ngate without hinges; we lifted the pickets out of notches in the fence\nand made a hole through which we passed into the lily field.\nNothing, not even fairyland, could have been so lovely as our lily\nfield. The wild lilies blossomed in April or May but they seemed to be\nalways in the field, because, the very first time you saw them, they\ndid something to the back of your eyes which kept themselves there,\nand something to your nose, so that you smelled them whenever\nyou thought of them. The field was roofed by tall, thin pine trees.\nThe ground underneath was clear and grassed. The lilies were\nthickly sprinkled everywhere. They were white, with gold in their\nhearts and brown eyes that stared back into the earth because their\nnecks hooked down. But each lily had five sharp white petals rolling\nback and pointing to the tree-tops, like millions and millions of\ntiny quivering fingers. The smell was fresh and earthy. I n all your\nthinkings you could picture nothing more beautiful than our lily\nfield.\nWe turned back towards our house then, and climbed a stile over\na snake fence. On the other side of the fence was a mass of r ock, rich\nand soft with moss, and all round it were mock-orange and spirea\nand oak trees.\nFather and Mother sat down upon the rock. You could see the\nthinking in their eyes. Father’s was proud thinking as he looked\nacross the beautiful place that he had made out of wild Canadian\nland—he thought how splendidly English he had made it look.\nMother’s eyes followed our whispered Sunday playing.\nWhen Father got up, Mother got up too. We walked round the\nlower hay field, going back into the garden by the black gate, on the\nopposite side of the house from which we had left. Then we admired\nthe vegetables, fruit and flowers until the front door flew open and\nDede jangled the big brass dinner bell for us to come in to tea.\nWhen the meal was finished the most sober part of all Sunday\ncame, and that was the Bible reading. Church and Sunday School\nhad partly belonged to Dr. Reid and Dede. The Bible reading was all\nGod’s. We all came into the sitting-room with our faces very straight\nand our Bibles in our hands.\nThere was always a nice fire in the grate, because, even in\nsummer, Victoria nights are chilly. The curtains were drawn across\nthe windows and the table was in front of the fire. It was a round\ntable with a red cloth, and the brass lamp sitting in the middle threw\na fine light on all the Bibles when we drew our chairs in close.\nFather’s chair was big and stuffed, Mother’s low, with a high back.\nThey faced each other where the table began to turn away from the\nfire. Between their chairs where it was too hot for anyone to sit, the\ncats lay sprawling on the rug before the fire. We circled between\nFather and Mother on the other side of the table.\nFather opened the big Family Bible at the place marked by the\ncross-stitch text Lizzie had worked. In the middle of the Bible,\nbetween the “old” and the “new”, were some blank pages, and all of\nus were written there. Sometimes Father let us look at ourselves and\nat William, John and Thomas who were each written there twice,\nonce for being born, and once for dying. That was the only time\nthat John, Thomas and William seemed to be real and take part in\nthe family’s doings. We did little sums with their Bible dates, but\ncould never remember if they had lived for days or years. As they\nwere dead before we were born, and we had never known them as\nJohnny- or Tommy- or Willie-babies, they felt old and grown up to\nus.\nTallie was more interested in the marriage page. There was only\none entry on it, “Richard and Emily Carr”, who were Father and\nMother.\nTallie said, “Father, Mother was only eighteen when she married\nyou, wasn’t she?”\n“Yes,” said Father, “ and had more sense than some girls I could\nname at t wenty.” He was always very frowny when the doorbell rang\nin the middle of Bible reading and Tallie went out and did not come\nback.\nWe read right straight through the Bible, begat chapters and all,\nthough even Father stuck at some of the names.\nOn and on we read till the nine o’clock gun went off at Esquimalt.\nFather, Mother, and Dede set their watches by the gun and then we\nwent on reading again until we came to the end of the chapter. The\nthree smallest of us had to spell out most of the words and be told\nhow to say them. We got most dreadfully sleepy. No matter how\nhard you pressed your finger down on the eighth verse from the\nlast one you had read, when the child next to you was finishing and\nkicked your shin you jumped and the place was lost. Then you got\nscolded and were furious with your finger. Mother said, “Richard,\nthe children are tired,” but Father said, “Attention! Children” and\nwent right on to the end of the chapter. He thought i t was rude to\nGod to stop in a chapter’s middle nor must we shut our Bibles up\nwith a glad bang when at last we were through.\nNo matter how sleepy we had been during Bible reading, when\nFather got out theSunday at Homewe were wide awake to hear\nthe short chapter of the serial story. Father did not believe in fairy\nstories for children.At the Back of the North Windwas as fairy as\nanything, but, because it was in theSunday at Home, F ather thought\nit was all right.\nWe kissed Mother good night. While the others were kissing\nFather I ran behind him (I did so hate kissing beards) and, if Father\nwas leaning back, I could just reach his bald spot and slap the kiss\nthere.\nDede lighted the candle and we followed her, peeping into the\ndrawing-room to say good night to Tallie and her beau. We did\nnot like him much because he kissed us and was preachy when we\ncheeked pretty Tallie, who did not rule over us as Dede did; but he\nbrought candy—chocolates for Tallie and a bag of “broken mixed”\nfor the children, big hunky pieces that sucked you right into sleep.\nDede put Dick to bed. Lizzie had a room of her own. Alice and I\nshared. We undid each other and brushed our hair to long sweet\nsuckings.\n“I wish he’d come in the morning before church.”\n“What for?”\n“Sunday’d be lots nicer if you could have a chunk of candy in your\ncheek all day.”\n“Stupid! Could you go to church with candy poking out of your\ncheek like another nose? Could you slobber candy over your Sunday\nSchool Lesson and the Bible reading?”\nAlice was two years older than I. She stopped brushing her long\nred hair, jumped into bed, leaned over the chair that the candle sat\non.\nPouf! ... Out went Sunday and the candle."

      "title": "The Cow Yard",
      "content": "The Cow Yardwas large. Not length and breadth alone determined\nits dimensions, it had height and depth also. Above it continually\nhovered the spirit of maternity. I ts good earth floor, hardened by\nmany feet, pulsed with rich growth wherever there was any\nprotection from the perpetual movement over its surface.\nAcross the ample width of the Cow Yard, the old Barn and the New\nBarn faced each other. Both were old, but one was very old; in it\nlodged the lesser creatures. The Cow alone occupied the New Barn.\nBut it was in the Cow Yard that you felt most strongly the warm\nlife-giving existence of the great red-and-white, loose-knit Cow.\nWhen she walked, her great bag swung slowly from side to side.\nFrom one end of her large-hipped square body nodded a massive\nhead, surmounted by long, pointed horns. From the other dangled\nher tail with its heavy curl and pendulum-like movement. As her\ncloven hoofs moved through the mud, they made a slow clinging\nsquelch, all in tune with the bagging, sagging, nodding, leisureliness\nof the Cow’s whole being.\nOf the three little girls who played in the Cow Yard, Bigger tired\nof i t soonest. Right through she was a pure, clean child, and had an\nenormous conscience. The garden rather than the Cow Yard suited\nher crisp frocks and tidy ways best, and she was a little afraid of the\nCow.\nMiddle was a born mother, and had huge doll families. She liked\nequally the tidy garden and the free Cow Yard.\nSmall was wholly a Cow Yard child.\nWhen the Cow’s nose was deep in her bran mash, and her milk\npurring into the pail in long, even streams, first sounding tinny\nin the empty pail and then making a deeper and richer sound as\nthe pail filled, Bong, sitting on his three-legged stool, sang to the\nCow—a Chinese song in a falsetto voice. The Cow took her nose\nout of the mash bucket, threw back her great ears, and listened.\nShe pulled a tuft of sweet hay from her rack, and stood quite still,\nchewing softly, her ears right about, so that she might not miss one\nbit of Bong’s song.\nOne of the seven gates of the Cow Yard opened into the Pond\nPlace. The Pond was round and deep, and the primroses and\ndaffodils that grew on its bank leaned so far over to peep at\nthemselves that some of them got drowned. Lilacs and pink and\nwhite may filled the air with sweetness in Spring. Birds nested there.\nThe Cow walked on a wide walk paved with stones when she came\nto the Pond to drink. Hurdles of iron ran down each side of the\nwalk and into the water, so that she should not go too far, and get\nmired. The three little girls who came to play used to roost on the\nhurdles and fish for tadpoles with an iron dipper that belonged to\nthe hens’ wheat-bin. From the brown surface of the water three\nupside-down little girls laughed up and mocked them, just as an\nupside-down Cow looked up from the water and mocked the Cow\nwhen she drank. Doubtless the tadpoles laughed, because down\nunder the water where they darted back and forth no upside-down\ntadpoles mocked.\nThe overflow from the Pond meandered through the Cow Yard\nin a wide, rock-bordered ditch. There were two bridges across the\nditch; one made of two planks for people to walk over, and the\nother made of logs, strong and wide enough for the Cow. The hens\ndrank from the running water. Musk grew under the Cow’s bridge;\nits yellow blossoms gleamed like cats’ eyes in the cool dark.\nSpecial things happened in the Cow Yard at each season of the\nyear, but the most special things happened in Spring.\nFirst came the bonfire. All winter the heap in the centre of the\nCow Yard had mounted higher and higher with orchard prunings,\nbranches that had blown down in the winter winds, old boxes and\nhens’ nests, garbage, and now, on top of all, the spring-cleaning\ndiscards.\nThe three little girls sat on three upturned barrels. Even Bigger,\nher hands folded in a spotless lap, enjoyed this Cow Yard event. The\nCow, safely off in the pasture, could not stamp and sway at her.\nMiddle, hugging a doll, and Small, hugging a kitten, banged their\nheels on the sides of the hollow barrels, which made splendid noises\nlike drums.\nThe man came from the barn with paper and matches, and off the\nbonfire blazed with a tremendous roar. I t was so hot that the barrels\nhad to be moved back. The hens ran helter-skelter. The rabbits\nwiggled their noses furiously as the whiffs of smoke reached their\nhutches. The ducks waddled off to the Pond to cool themselves.\nSoon there was nothing left of the bonfire but ashes and red embers.\nThen the barrels were rolled up close, and the three little girls\nroasted potatoes in the hot ashes.\nBigger told stories while the potatoes roasted. Her stories were\ngrand and impossible, and when they soared beyond imagining,\nSmall said, “Let’s have some real ones now,” and turned to Middle,\n“Will you marry?”\n“Of course,” came the prompt reply. “ And I shall have a hundred\nchildren. Will you?”\nSmall considered. “Well, that depends. If I don’t join a circus and\nride a white horse through hoops of fire, I may marry a farmer, if\nhe has plenty of creatures. That is, I wouldn’t marry just a vegetable\nman.”\n“I am going to be a missionary,” said Bigger, “ and go out to the\nHeathen.”\n“Huh! if you’re scared of our old cow, what will you be of\ncannibals?” said Small. “Why not marry a missionary, and send him\nout first, so they wouldn’t be so hungry when you got there?”\n“You are a foolish child,” said Bigger. “The potatoes are cooked.\nYou fish them out, Small, your hands and pinafore are dirty anyway.”\nThe ashes of the bonfire were scarcely cold before Spring burst\nthrough the brown earth, and the ashes and everything. The Cow\nand the chickens kept the tender green shoots cropped down, but\nevery night more pushed up and would not be kept under. The Cow\nwatched the willow trees that grew beside the Pond. Just before the\nsilky grey pussies burst their buds, she licked up as far as she could\nreach and ate them, blowing hard, upside-down sniffs—all puff-out\nand no pull-in—as though the bitter-sweet of the pussy-willows was\nvery agreeable to her. She stood with half-closed eyes, chewing and\nrolling her jaws from side to side, with delighted slobbering.\nAbout this time, the fussy old hens got fussier. After sticking their\nfeathers on end, and clucking and squawking and being annoyed\nat everybody, they suddenly sat down on their nests, and refused\nto get up, staring into space as though their orange eyes saw\nsomething away off. Then they were moved into a quiet shed and\nput into clean boxes of hollowed-out hay, f illed with eggs. They sat\non top of the eggs for ages and ages. If you put your hand on them,\nthey flattened their feathers to their bodies and their bodies down\non their eggs and gave beaky growls. Then, when you had almost\nforgotten that they ever had legs and could walk, you went to the\nshed and put food and water before them. Fluffy chickens peeped\nout of every corner of the hen’s feathers, till she looked as fat as\nseven hens. Then she strutted out into the yard, to brag before the\nother creatures, with all the chicks bobbing behind her.\nOne old hen was delighted with her chickens and went off,\nclucking to keep them close, and scratching up grubs and insects\nfor them by the way, but when they came to the ditch her little ones\njumped into the water and swam off. She felt that life had cheated\nher, and she sat down and sulked.\n“How mad she must be, after sitting so long,” said Bigger.\n“As long as they are alive, I don’t see why she should care,” said\nMiddle. “They’ll come to her to be cuddled when they are tired and\ncold.”\n“Oh, girls,” cried Small, bursting with a big idea, “if the hen\nhatched ducks, why couldn’t the Cow have a colt? It would be so\nsplendid to have a horse!”\nBigger got up from the stone where she was sitting. “Come on,”\nshe said to Middle, “she is such a foolish child. Let’s play ladies in the\ngarden, and leave her to mudpuddle in the Cow Yard.”\nThe ducklings crept back to the old hen when they were tired,\njust as Middle had said they would. The old hen squatted down\ndelightedly, loosening up her feathers, and the little ducks snuggled\namong them.\n“Aren’t they beastly wet and cold against your skin?” shouted\nSmall across the ditch to the hen. “Gee, don’t mothers love hard!”\nShe cast a look around the yard. Through the fence she saw the\ncow in the pasture, chewing drowsily. Spring sunshine, new grass,\ndaisies and buttercups filled the pasture. The Cow had not a trouble\nin the world.\nSmall nodded to the Cow. “ All the same, old Cow, I do wish you\ncould do something about a colt. Oh dear, I do want to learn to ride!”\nSuddenly she sprang up, jumped the ditch, tiptoed to reach the\niron hoop that kept the pasture-gate fast, and ran up to the cow. “Be\na sport, old girl,” she whispered in the great hairy ear, and taking her\nby the horn she led the Cow up to the fence.\nThe Cow stood meek and still. Small climbed to the top rail of the\nfence, and jumped on the broad expanse of r ed back, far too wide for\nher short legs to grip. For one still moment, while the slow mind of\nthe Cow surmounted her astonishment, Small sat in the wide valley\nbetween horns and hip-bones. Then it seemed as though the Cow\nfell apart, and as if every part of her shot in a different direction.\nSmall hurled through space and bumped hard. “Beast!” she\ngasped, when she had sorted herself from the mud and the stones.\n“Bong may call you the Old Lady, but I call you a mean, miserable old\ncow.” And she shook her fist at the still-waving heels and tail at the\nother end of the pasture.\nThat night, when Small showed Middle the bruises, and explained\nhow they had come, Middle said, “I expect you had better marry a\nfarmer; maybe you’re not exactly suited for a circus rider.”\nSpring had just about filled up the Cow Yard. The rabbits’ secrets\nwere all out now. They had bunged up the doors of their sleeping\nboxes with hay and stuff, and had pretended that there was nothing\nthere at all. But if you went too close, they stamped their feet and\nwagged their ears, and made out that they were brave as lions. But\nnow that i t had got too stuffy in the boxes, the mother pulled down\nthe barricade and all the fluffy babies scampered out, more than you\ncould count.\nOne day when the Cow was standing under the loft, the loveliest\nbaby pigeon fell plumb on her back. But there were so many young\nthings around, all more or less foolish, that the Cow was not even\nsurprised.\nThen one morning the Father called the little girls into the Cow\nYard, to see the pigmy image of the Old Cow herself, spot for spot,\nexcept that i t had no wisdom. He had a foolish baby face and foolish\nlegs; he seemed to wonder whose legs these were, and never\ndreamed that they were his own. But he was sure that he owned his\ntail, and flipped it joyously.\nThe Cow was terribly proud of him, and licked him and licked him\ntill all his hair crinkled up.\nNow, the Cow Yard was not Heaven, so of course bad things and\nsad things happened there too.\nClose by the side of the ditch was a tree covered with ivy. The\nrunning water had washed some of the roots bare, and they stuck\nout. When the little girls sailed boats down the ditch, the roots\ntipped the boats and tried to drown the dolls.\nIt was not a very big tree, but the heavy bunch of ivy that hung\nabout it made it look immense. The leaves of the ivy formed a\ndense dark surface about a foot away from the bole of the tree, for\nthe leaves hung on long stems. The question was—what filled the\nmysterious space between the leaves and the tree? Away above the\nivy, at the top, the bare branches of the tree waved skinny arms, as\nif they warned you that something terrible was there.\nOne day the children heard the Father say to the Mother, “ The ivy\nhas killed that tree.”\nIt was strange that the ivy could kill anything. Small thought about\nit a lot, but she did not like to ask the older ones, who thought her\nquestions silly. She would not have thrust her arm into that space\nfor anything.\nThe pigeons flew over the tree, from the roof of one barn to\nthe roof of the other, but they never lighted on it. Sometimes the\nnoisy barn sparrows flew into the ivy; they were instantly silent, and\nyou never saw them come out. Sometimes owls hoo-hoo-hooed in\nthere. Once when Small was sitting on the chopping block, one flew\nout, perfectly silently, as though its business were very secret. Small\ncrept home and up to bed, although it was not quite time, and drew\nthe covers tight up over her head. To herself she called that tree\n“The Killing Tree”.\nThen one day she found a dead sparrow under the Killing Tree.\nShe picked it up. The bird was cold, its head flopped over her\nhand; the rest of i t was stiff and its legs stuck up. Queer grey lids\ncovered its eyes.\nSmall buried it in a little box filled with violets. A week later she\ndug it up, to see just what did happen to dead things. The bird’s eyes\nwere sunk away back in its head. There were some worms in the\nbox, and it smelled horrid. Small buried the bird in the earth again\nquickly.\nWinter came by and by and, looking out from their bedroom\nwindow, Middle said, “The Old Cow Yard tree is down.” They dressed\nquickly and went to look.\nThe tree had broken the Cow’s bridge and lay across the ditch,\nthe forlorn top broken and pitiful. The heavy ivy, looking blacker than\never against the snow, still hid the mystery place.\n“Mercy, i t’s good it did not fall on the Cow and kill her,” said Small.\n“It’s a beastly tree and I’m glad it is down!”\n“Why should it fall on the Cow? And why was it a beastly tree?”\nasked Middle.\n“Because and because,” said Small, and pressed her lips together\ntight.\n“Youaresilly,” retorted Middle.\nWhen they came back from school, the top branches were\nchopped up, and the ivy piled ready for burning. The little tawny\nroots of the ivy stuck out all over the bole like coarse hair. The Man\nwas sawing the tree in lengths. He rolled one towards the children.\n“Here’s a seat f or you,” he said. Middle sat down. Small came close to\nthe Man.\n“Mr. Jack, when you chopped the ivy off the tree did you find\nanything in there?”\n“Why, I found the tree.”\n“I mean,” said Small in a tense voice, “anything between the tree\nand the ivy?”\n“There wasn’t nothing in there that I saw,” replied the man. “Did\nyou lose a ball or something maybe?”\n“When are you going to burn the ivy?”\n“Just waiting till you came home from school,” and he struck a\nmatch.\nDense, acrid smoke blinded the children. When they could see\nagain, long tongues of flame were licking the leaves, which hissed\nback like a hundred angry cats, before they parched, crackled, and\nfinally burst into flames.\n“Isn’t it a splendid bonfire?” asked Middle. “Shall we cook\npotatoes?”\n“No,” said Small.\nThe next spring, when everyone had forgotten that there ever had\nbeen a Cow Yard tree, the Father bought a horse. The Cow Yard was\nfilled with excitement; children shouted, hens ran, ducks waddled\noff quacking, but the Cow did not even look up. She went right\non eating some greens from a pile thrown over the fence from the\nvegetable garden.\n“I suppose we shall have to call it the Horse Yard now,” said Small.\n“He’s bigger and so much grander than the Cow.”\nMiddle gave the horse an appraising look. “Higher, but not so\nthick,” she said.\nThe horse saw the pile of greens. He held his head high, and there\nwas confidence in the ring of his iron shoes as he crossed the bridge.\nThe Cow munched on, flapping the flies off her sides with a lazy\ntail. When she got a particularly juicy green, her tail forgot to flap,\nand lay curled across her back.\nWhen the horse came close, the tail jumped off the cow’s back and\nswished across his nose. He snorted and pulled back, but still kept\nhis eyes on the pile of greens. He left his four feet and the tips of his\nears just where they had been, but the roots of his ears, and his neck\nand lips stretched forward towards the greens till he looked as if he\nwould fall for crookedness. The Cow’s head moved ever so little; she\ngave him a look, and pointed one horn right at his eye. His body shot\nback to where it should be, square above his legs, and he sighed and\nturned away, with his ears and tail pressed down tight.\n“I guess it will be all right f or us to call it the Cow Yard still,” said\nMiddle."

How she did love him!\nWhen they had told her, “ You may take your pick,” and she leaned\nover the cage and saw the four fluffy yellow balls, too young to have\neven sung their first song, her breath and her heart acted so queerly\nthat it seemed as if she must strangle.\nShe chose the one with the topknot. He was the first live creature\nshe had ever owned.\n“Mine! I shall be his God,” she whispered.\nHow could she time her dancing feet to careful stepping? She was\nglad the cage protected him sufficiently so that she could hug it\nwithout hurting him.\nSave for the flowers that poked their faces through the fences,\nand for the sunshine, the long street was empty. She wished that\nthere was someone to show him to—someone to say, “He is lovely!”\nA gate opened and the Bishop stepped into the street. The Bishop\nwas very holy—everybody said so. His eyes were blue, as if by his\nperpetual contemplation of Heaven they had taken its colour. His\ngentle voice, vague and distant, came from up there too. His plump\nhands were transparent against the clerically black vest.\nThough she played ladies with his little girls, Small stood in great\nawe of the Bishop. She had never voluntarily addressed him. When\nthey were playing in his house, the children tiptoed past his study.\nGod and the Bishop were in there making new hymns and collects.\nHer lovely bird! Because there was no one else to show him to she\nmust show him to the Bishop. Birds belonged to the sky. The Bishop\nwould understand. She was not at all afraid now. The bird gave her\ncourage.\nShe ran across the street.\n“Look, Bishop! Look at my bird!”\nThe Bishop’s thoughts were too far away, he did not heed nor even\nhear the cry of joy.\nShe stood before him with the cage held high. “Bishop! Oh please\nBishop, see!”\nDimly the Bishop became aware of some object obstructing his\nway. He laid a dimpled hand upon the little girl’s head.\n“Ah, child, you are a pretty picture,” he said, and moved her gently\nfrom his path.\nThe Bishop went his way. The child stood still.\n“My beautiful bird!”\nThe look of hurt fury which she hurled at the Bishop’s back might\nhave singed his clerical broadcloth."

      "content": "Father’sreligion was grim and stern, Mother’s gentle. Father’s\noperated through the Presbyterian, Mother’s through the Anglican\nChurch.Ourreligion was hybrid: on Sunday morning we were\nPresbyterian, Sunday evening we were Anglican.\nOur little Presbyterian legs ached from the long walk to church on\nSunday morning. Our hearts got heavy and our eyes tired before the\nPresbyterian prayers and the long Presbyterian sermon were over.\nEven so, we felt a strong “rightness” about Father’s church which\nmade it endurable. Through scorch of summer heat, through snow\nand rain, we all taggled along behind Father. Toothaches, headaches,\nstomach-aches—nothing was strong enough to dodge or elude\nmorning religion.\nMother’s religion was a Sunday evening privilege. The Anglican\nchurch was much nearer our house than the Presbyterian, just a\nlittle walk down over Marvin’s Hill to our own James’ Bay mud flats.\nThe little church sat on the dry rim just above the far side.\nEvening service was a treat that depended on whether big sister\nwanted to be bothered with us. Being out at night was very special\ntoo—moon and stars so high, town lights and harbour lights low and\ntwinkly when seen from the top of Marvin’s Hill on our side of the\nmud flats. A river of meandering sludge loitered its way through\nthe mud—a huge silver snake that twisted among the sea-grass. On\nthe opposite side of the little valley, on a rocky ridge, stood Christ\nChurch Cathedral, black against the night-blue of the sky. Christ\nChurch had chimes and played scales on them to walk her people\nto church. As we had no chimes, not even a bell on our church, we\nmarched along on the spare noise of the Cathedral chimes.\nThe mud flats did not always smell nice although the bushes of\nsweet-briar on the edge of the high-water rim did their best, and\nthe sea crept in between the calfless wooden legs of James’ Bay\nBridge, washed the muddied grass and stole out again.\nOur Church was mellow. I t had a gentle, mild Bishop. He wore\na long black gown with a long white surplice over it. His immense\npuffed sleeves were caught in at the wrists by black bands and fluted\nout again in little white frills round his wrists. There was a dimple\non each knuckle of his hands. He was a wide man and looked wider\nin his surplice, especially from our pew which was close up under\nthe pulpit. He looked very high above us and every time he caught\nhis breath his beard hoisted and waved out.\nThe Bishop’s voice was as gentle as if it came from the moon.\nEvery one of his sentences was separated from the next by a wheezy\nlittle gasp. His face was round and circled by a mist of white hair. He\nkept the lids shut over his blue, blue eyes most of the time, as if he\nwas afraid their blueness would fade. When you stood before him\nyou felt it was the lids of his own eyes he saw, not you.\nThe Bishop’s favourite word was “Ah!”, not mournful or vexed\n“ahs”, just slow contemplating “ahs”. But it was the Bishop’s Blessing!\nHe blessed most splendidly! From the moment you went into church\nyou waited for it. You could nap through most of the Presbyterian\nsermon, but, although the pews were most comfortable, red\ncushions, footstools and all, you dared not nap through the Bishop’s\nfor fear you’d miss the blessing.\nOur Evangelical church was beautiful. There was lots of music. A\nlady in a little red velvet bonnet, with strings under the chin, played\nthe organ.\nThere were four splendid chandeliers dangling high under the\nroof. They had round, wide reflectors made of very shiny, very\ncrinkly tin. Every crinkle caught i ts own particular bit of light and\ntossed it round the church—and up there ever so high the gas jets\nhissed and flickered. Music stole whispering from the organ and\ncrept up among the chandeliers and the polished rafters to make\nechoes.\nOur choir was mixed and sang in every sort of clothes, not in\nsurplices like the Cathedral choir on the hill.\nThe Bishop climbed into the pulpit. He laid the sheets of his\nsermon on the open Bible which sat on a red velvet cushion; then he\nshut his eyes and began to preach. Once in a while he would stop,\nopen his eyes, put on his glasses and read back to be sure he had not\nskipped.\nWhen the last page was turned the Bishop said a gentle “Amen”\nand then he lifted his big round sleeves with his hands dangling out\nof the ends. We all stood up and drooped our heads. The church\nwas full of stillness. The Bishop curved his palms out over us—they\nlooked pink against his white sleeves. He gave the blessing just as if\nhe was taking it straight from God and giving it to us.\nThen the Bishop came down the pulpit stairs; the organ played\nand the choir sang him into the vestry; the verger nipped the side\nlights off in such a hurry that everyone fell over a footstool.\nBig doors rolled back into the wall on either side of the church\ndoor to let us out. As soon as we were all in the night the verger\nrolled shut the doors and blotted out the chandeliers.\nWe climbed Marvin’s Hill, each of us carrying home a bit of the\nBishop’s blessing."

      "title": "Singing",
      "content": "Small’s singing was joyful noise more than music; what it lacked\nin elegance it made up in volume. As fire cannot help giving heat\nso Small’s happiness could not help giving song, in spite of family\ncomplaint. They called her singing a “horrible row”, and said it\nshamed them before the neighbours, but Small sang on. She sang\nin the cow-yard mostly, not that she went there specially to sing,\nbut she was so happy when she was there among the creatures that\nthe singing did itself. She had but to open her mouth and the noise\njumped out.\nThe moment Small sat down upon the cow-yard woodpile the big\nrooster would jump into her lap and the cow amble across the yard\nto plant her squareness, one leg under each corner right in front of\nSmall and, to shut out completely the view of the old red barn, the\nhen houses, and the manure-pile.\nThe straight outline of the cow’s back in front of Small was like a\nrange of mountains with low hills and little valleys. The tail end of\nthe cow was as square as a box. Horns were her only curve—back,\nfront, tail, neck and nose in profile, were all straight lines. Even the\nslobber dripping from her chin fell in slithery streaks.\nWhen Small began to sing the old cow’s nose-line shot from\nstraight down to straight out, her chin rose into the air, her jaws\nrolled. The harder Small sang, the harder the cow chewed and the\nfaster she twiddled her ears around as if stirring the song into the\nfood to be rechewed in cud along with her breakfast.\nSmall loved her cow-yard audience—hens twisting their silly\nheads and clawing the earth with mincing feet, their down eye\nlooking for grubs, their up eye peering at Small, ducks trying hard\nto out-quack the song, pigeons clapping their white wings, rabbits\nhoisting and sinking their noses—whether in appreciation or\nderision Small could never tell.\nWhite fluttered through the cow-yard gate, Bigger’s apron\nheralding an agitated Bigger, both hands wrestling with the buttons\nof her apron behind and her tongue ready sharpened to attack\nSmall’s singing.\n“It’s disgusting! Stop that vulgar row, Small! What must the\nneighbours think? Stop it, I say!”\nSmall sang harder, bellowing the words, “The cow likes it and this\nis her yard.”\n“I wish to goodness that she would roof her yard then, or that you\nwould sing under an umbrella, Small, and so keep the sound down\nand not let i t boil over the fences. There’s the breakfast bell! Throw\nthat fowl out of your lap and come! Song before breakfast means\ntears before night.”\n“Whose tears—mine, the cow’s or the rooster’s?”\n“Oh, oh, oh! That cow-brute has dripped slobber down my clean\napron! You’re a disgusting pair,” shrieked Bigger and rushed from the\nyard.\nBreakfast over, the Elder detained Small.\n“Small, this singing of yours is scandalous! Yesterday I was walking\nup the street with a lady. Half a block from our gate she stopped\ndead. ‘Listen! Someone is in trouble,’ she said. How do you think I\nfelt saying, ‘Oh, no, it is only my little sister singing’?”\nSmall reddened but said stubbornly, “The cow likes my singing.”\nCows are different from humans; perhaps the hairiness of their\nears strains sound.\nThe Bishop came to pay a sick-visit to Small’s mother. He prayed\nand Small watched and listened. His deliberate chewing of the\nwords, with closed eyes, reminded her of the cow chewing her cud.\nThe Bishop was squarely built, a slow calm man. “They are very\nalike,” thought Small.\nRising from his knees, the Bishop, aware of the little girl’s stare,\nsaid, “You grow, child!”\n“She does,” said Small’s mother. “So does her voice; her singing is\nrather a family problem.”\n“Song is good,” replied the Bishop. “Is it hymns you sing, child?”\n“No, Mr. Bishop, I prefer cow-songs.”\nThe Bishop’s “a-a-h!” long-drawn and flat lasted all the way down\nthe stairs.\n“You should not have said that,” said Small’s mother. “ A Bishop is a\nBishop.”\n“And a cow is a cow. Is it so wicked to sing to a cow?”\n“Not wicked at all. I love your happy cow-yard songs coming into\nmy window. We will have your voice trained some day. Then perhaps\nthe others will not scold so much about your singing.”\n“But will the cow like my voice squeezed little and polite? It won’t\nbe half so much fun singing beautifully as boiling over like the jam\nkettle.”\nSmall’s four sisters and her brother went holidaying to a farm in\nMetchosin. Small was left at home with her mother. Just at first\nSmall, to whom animal life was so dear, f elt a pang that she was\nnot of the farm party. But the quiet of the empty house was a new\nexperience and something happened.\nMrs. Gregory, her mother’s friend of long standing, came to spend\nan afternoon.\nBoth ladies were nearing the age of f ifty—straight-backed, neatly\nmade little ladies who sat primly on the horsehair chairs in the\ndrawing-room wearing little lace-trimmed matron’s caps and\nstitching each on a piece of plain sewing as they chatted.\nHaving exchanged recipes for puddings, discussed the virtue of\nred flannel as against white, the problem of Chinese help and the\nsewing-circle where they made brown holland aprons for orphans,\nall topics were exhausted.\nThey sewed in silence, broken after a bit by Mrs. Gregory saying,\n“There was English mail this morning, Emily. Do you ever get\nhomesick for the Old Country?”\nSmall’s mother looked with empty eyes across the garden. “My\nhome and my family are here,” she replied.\nThe ladies began “remembering”. One would say, “Do you\nremember?” and the other would say, “I call to mind.” Soon this\nremembering carried them right away from that Canadian drawing-\nroom. They were back in Devonshire lanes, girl brides rambling\nalong with their Richard and William, pausing now and then to\ngather primroses and to listen to the larks and cuckoos.\nSmall’s mother said, “Richard was always one for wanting to see\nnew countries.”\n“My William’s hobby,” said Mrs. Gregory, “was growing things.\nHere or there made no difference to him as long as there was earth\nto dig and flowers to grow.”\nSmall knew that Richard and William were her father and Mr.\nGregory or she would never have recognized the ladies’ two jokey\nboys of the Devonshire lanes in the grave middle-aged men she\nknew as her father and Mrs. Gregory’s husband.\nThe ladies laid their sewing upon the table and, dropping their\nhands into their laps, sat idle, relaxing their shoulders into the hard\nbacks of the chairs. Small felt it extraordinary to see them doing\nnothing, to see Canada suddenly spill out of their eyes as if a dam\nhad burst and let the pent-up England behind drown Canada, to see\nthem sitting in real chairs and yet not there at all.\nThe house was quite still. In the yard Bong was chopping kindling\nand droning a little Chinese song.\nSuddenly Mrs. Gregory said, “Emily, let’s sing!” and began:\n“I cannot sing the old songs now I sang long years ago. . . .”\nSmall’s mother joined, no shyness, no hesitation. The two rusty\nlittle voices lifted, found to their amazement that they could sing\nthe old songs still, and their voices got stronger and stronger with\neach song.\nSitting on a stool between them, half hidden by the table-cloth\nand entirely forgotten by the ladies, Small watched and listened,\nsaw their still fingers, unornamented except for the plain gold band\non the third left of each hand, lying in sober-coloured stuff-dress\nlaps, little white caps perched on hair yet brown, lace jabots pinned\nunder their chins by huge brooches. Mrs. Gregory’s brooch was\ncomposed of tiny flowers woven from human hair grown on the\nheads of various members of her family. The flowers were glassed\nover the top and framed in gold, and there were earrings to match\ndangling from her ears. The brooch Small’s mother wore was made\nof quartz with veins of gold running through it. Richard had dug\nthe quartz himself from the California gold mines and had had it\nmounted in gold for his wife with earrings of the same.\nEach lady had winds and winds of thin gold watch-chain round\nher neck, chains which tethered gold watches hiding in stitched\npockets on the fronts of their dresses. There the ladies’ hearts and\ntheir watches could tick duets.\nSmall sat still as a mouse. The singing was as solemn to her\nas church. She had always supposed that Mother-ladies stopped\nsinging when there were no more babies in their nurseries to be\nsung to. Here were two ladies nearly fifty years old, throwing back\ntheir heads to sing love songs, nursery songs, hymns, God Save the\nQueen, Rule Britannia—songs that spilled over the drawing-room as\neasily as Small’s cow songs spilled over the yard, only Small’s songs\nwere new, fresh grass snatched as the cow snatched pasture grass.\nThe ladies’ songs were re-chews—cudded fodder.\nSmall sneezed!\nTwo mouths snapped like mousetraps! Four cheeks flushed!\nSeizing her sewing, Mrs. Gregory said sharply, “Hunt my thimble,\nchild!”\nSmall’s mother said, “I clean forgot the tea,” and hurried from the\nroom.\nSmall never told a soul about that singing but now, when she sat\non the cow-yard woodpile she raised her chin and sang clean over\nthe cow’s back, over the yard and over the garden, straight into her\nmother’s window . . . let Bigger and the Elder scold!"

      "title": "The Praying Chair",
      "content": "The wicker chair was new and had a crisp creak. At a quarter to\neight every morning Father sat in it to read family prayers. The little\nbook the prayers came out of was sewed into a black calico pinafore\nbecause its own cover was a vivid colour and Father did not think\nthat was reverent.\nThe Elder, a sister much older than the rest of the children, knelt\nbefore a hard, straight chair; Mother and little Dick knelt together\nat a low soft chair. The three little girls, Bigger, Middle, and Small\nusually knelt in the bay window and buried their faces in its\ncushioned seat but Small’s Father liked her to kneel beside him\nsometimes. If she did not get her face down quickly he beckoned\nand Small had to go from the window-seat to under the arm of the\nwicker chair. I t was stuffy under there. Small liked the window-seat\nbest, where she could peep and count how many morning-glories\nwere out, how many new rosebuds climbing to look in through the\nwindow at her.\nFather’s wicker chair helped pray. I t creaked and whispered more\nthan the children would ever have dared to. When finally Father\nleaned across the arm to reach for the cross-work book-mark he\nhad laid on the table during prayers, the chair squawked a perfectly\ngrand Amen.\nOne morning Father had a bit of gout and Small thought that\ninstead of Amen Father said “Ouch!” She could not be quite sure\nbecause just at the very moment that the chair amened, Tibby, the\ncat, gave a tremendous “meow” and a splendid idea popped into\nSmall’s head.\nSmall had wanted a dog—she did not remember how long she had\nwanted it—it must have been from the beginning of the world. The\nbigger she got the harder she wanted.\nAs soon as everyone had gone about their day’s business Small\ntook Tibby and went back to the praying chair.\n“Look, Tibby, let’s you and me and the praying chair ask God to\ngive you a puppy for me. Hens get ducks, why couldn’t you get a\npuppy? Father always sits in that chair to pray. I t must be a good\nchair; it amens splendidly. I ’ll do the words: you and the chair can\namen. I don’t mind what kind of a puppy it is as long as it’s alive.”\nShe tipped the chair and poked Tibby underneath into the cage-\nlike base. Tibby left her tail out.\n“So much the better,” said Small. “It’ll pinch when the time for\namen is ready.”\nTibby’s amen was so effective that Small’s Mother came to see\nwhat was the trouble.\n“Poor cat! Her tail is pinched. Take her out into the garden, Small.”\n“It’s all spoilt now!”\n“What is?”\n“We were praying for a puppy.”\n“Your father won’t hear of a puppy in his garden, Small.”\nSmall’s birthday was coming.\nThe Elder said, “I know something that is coming for your\nbirthday!”\n“Is it—is it—”\n“Wait and see.”\n“Does it commence with ‘d’? Or, if it’s just a little one, maybe with\n‘p’?”\n“I think it does.”\nThe day before the great day Small’s singing was a greater\nnuisance than usual. Everyone scolded ’til she danced off to the\nwoodshed to sing there, selected three boxes of varying sizes and\nbrushed them out.\n“Which size will fit him? Middle, when you got your new hair-\nbrush what did you do with the old one?”\n“Threw it out.”\nSmall searched the rubbish pile which was waiting for the Spring\nbonfire and found the brush-back with its few remaining bristles.\n“A lot of brushing with a few is as good as a little brushing with a\nlot . . .”\n“Rosie,” she said to the wax doll whose face had melted smooth\nbecause a mother, careless of dead dolls, had left her sitting in the\nsun, “Rosie, I shall give your woollie to my new pup. You are all cold\nanyhow. You melt if you are warmed. Pups are live and shivery . . .”\n“He . . . she . . . Oh, Rosie, whatshallI do if it’s a she? It took years\nto think up a good enough name and it’s a boy’s name. Oh, well, if\nit’s a girl she’ll have thousands of puppies; the Elder says they always\ndo.”\nShe plaited a collar of bright braid, sewing on three hooks and\neyes at varying distances.\n“Will he be so big—or so big—or so big? I don’t care about his size\nor shape or colour as long as he’s alive.”\nShe put the collar into the pocket of tomorrow’s clean pinafore.\n“Hurry up and go, day, so that tomorrow can come!” And she went\noff to bed so as to hurry night.\nSmall’s father drew back the front-door bolt; that only half\nunlocked the new day—the little prayerbook in its drab covering did\nthe rest. It seemed a terrible time before the chair arm squeaked\nAmen. The Elder rose, slow as a snail. Small wanted to shout, “Hurry,\nhurry! Get the pup for me!”\nEveryone kissed Small for her birthday; then all went into the\nbreakfast-room. On Small’s plate was a flat, flat parcel. Small’s eyes\nfilled, drowning the gladness.\n“Open it!” shouted everyone.\nThe Elder cut the string. “I am glad to see,” she remarked, noting\nSmall’s quivering blue hands, “that you did not shirk your cold bath\nbecause it was your birthday.”\nThe present was the picture of a little girl holding a dog in her\narms.\n“She looks like you,” said Middle.\n“No, she isn’t like me, she has a dog.”\nSmall went to the fire pretending to warm her blue hands. She\ntook something from her apron pocket, dropped it into the flames.\n“I’m not hungry—can I go and feed my ducks?” In the cow-yard\nshe could cry.\nThe birthday dawdled. Small went to bed early that night too.\n“Small, you forgot your prayers!” cried Bigger.\n“I didn’t—God’s deaf.”\n“You’re dreadfully, dreadfully wicked—maybe you’ll die in the\nnight.”\n“Don’t care.”\nYears passed. Small’s father and mother were dead. The Elder\nwas no more reasonable than Small’s father had been about dogs.\nSmall never asked now, but the want was still there, grown larger.\nBigger, Middle and Small were grown up, but the Elder still regarded\nthem as children, allowed them no rights. Like every girl Small built\ncastles in the air. Her castle was an ark, her man a Noah, she tended\nthe beasts.\nUnexpected as Amen in a sermon’s middle came Small’s dog. She\nhad been away for a long, long time; on her return the Elder was\nsoftened. Wanting to keep Small home, she said, “There’s a dog in\nthe yard for you.”\nDabbing a kiss on the Elder’s cheek Small rushed. Kneeling she\ntook the dog’s muzzle between her hands. He sniffed, licked,\naccepted. Maybe he too had waited for a human peculiarly his.\nShe loosed him. He circled round and round. Was he scenting the\ndream-pup jealously?\nHe had been named already. The dream-pup would always keep\nthe name that had been his for his own.\n“He’ll run away—chain him. Remember he must not come in the\nhouse Small!”\nSmall roamed beach and woods, the dog with her always. Owning\nhim was better even than she had dreamed.\nSmall sat on a park bench waiting for a pupil, the dog asleep at her\nfeet. The child-pupil, planning a surprise for Small, stole up behind\nher and threw her arms round her neck. Small screamed. The dog\nsprang, caught the child’s arm between his teeth, made two tiny\nbruises and dropped down—shamed.\n“That dog is vicious,” said the Elder.\n“Oh, no, he thought someone was hurting me; he was dreadfully\nashamed when he saw that it was a child.”\n“He must be kept chained.”\nChickens for table use were killed close to the dog’s kennel. He\nsmelled the blood—heard their squawks. The maid took a long\nfeather and tickled his nose with it. He sprang, caught the girl’s hand\ninstead of the feather. The Elder’s mouth went hard and grim.\n“I teased him beyond endurance,” pleaded the maid.\nThat day Small was hurt in an accident. The dog was not allowed\nto go to her room. Broken-hearted he lay in his kennel, disgraced,\nforsaken. Small was sent away to an old friend to recuperate. The\nday before she was to return, the old lady’s son came to Small\nblurting, “They’ve killed your dog.”\n“Cruel, unjust, beastly!” shrieked Small.\n“Hush!” commanded the old lady. “The dog was vicious.”\n“He was not! He was not! Both times he was provoked!”\nSmall ran and ran across fields till she dropped face down among\nthe standing grain. There was a dark patch on the earth where her\ntears fell among roots of the grain.\n“Only a dog! This is wrong, Small,” said the not-understanding old\nwoman.\nSmall went home and for six weeks spoke no word to the\nElder—very few to anybody. She loathed the Elder’s hands; they\nmade her sick. Finally the Elder lost patience. “I did not kill the\nvicious brute,” she cried. “The police shot him.”\n“You made them!”\nSmall could look at the Elder’s hands again.\nSmall was middle-aged; she built a house. The Elder had offered\nher another dog. “Never till I have a home of my own,” she had said.\nThe Elder shrugged.\nNow that Small had her house, the Elder criticized it. “Too far\nforward,” she said. “You could have a nice front garden.”\n“I wanted a large back yard.”\n“A glut of dogs, eh Small?”\n“A kennel of Bobtail Sheep dogs.”\nThe Elder poked a head, white now, into Small’s puppy nursery.\n“What are you doing, Small?”\n“Bottling puppies—too many for the mothers.”\n“Why not bucket them?”\n“There is demand for them—sheep dogs—cattle dogs.”\n“How many pups just now?”\n“Eve’s eight, Rhoda’s seven, Loo’s nine.”\n“Twenty-four—mercy! and, besides, those absurd bearded old\npatriarchs—Moses, Adam and the rest.”\n“Open the door for Adam.”\nThe kennel sire entered, shaggy, noble, majestic. He rested his\nchin a moment on Small’s shoulder where she sat with pup and\nfeeding bottle, ran his eye round the walls where his mates and\ntheir families cuddled in boxes. He embraced all in good fellowship,\nincluding the Elder, picked the sunniest spot on the nursery floor\nand sprawled out.\n“Oh, Small, I was throwing out Father’s old wicker chair. Would\nyou like it in the kennel nursery to sit in while bottling the pups?”\n“The praying chair?—Oh, yes.”\nSo the Praying Chair came to Small’s kennel. Sitting in it Small\nremembered Tibby, the picture pup, the want, her first dog. Adam\nrested his chin on the old chair’s arm. Small leaned forward to\nrest her cheek against his woolly head. All rasp, all crispness gone,\n“Amen”, whispered the Praying Chair."

      "title": "Mrs. Crane",
      "content": "I heard two women talking. One said to the other, “Mrs. Crane has a\nlarge heart.”\n“Yes,” replied her companion, “and it is in the right place too.”\nI thought, “That’s queer—hearts are in the middle of people. How\ncan any person know if another person’s heart is big or small, or if it\nis in the right or the wrong place?”\nSoon after I heard this conversation about Mrs. Crane’s heart, our\nMother was seized with a very serious illness. My sister Alice and\nI—she was two years older—were hushed into the garden with our\ndolls and there, peeping from behind the currant bushes, we saw a\nhigh yellow dogcart stop in front of our gate. Mrs. Crane descended\nfrom it and came stalking up our garden walk.\n“Come to enquire, I s’pose,” whispered Alice.\n“My! Isn’t she long and narrow?” I replied.\nSilently I fell to trying to make all the different hearts I knew fit\ninto Mrs. Crane’s body—the gold locket one that made your neck\nshiver, beautiful valentine ones with forget-me-nots around them,\nsugar hearts, with mottoes, a horrible brown thing Mother said was\na pig’s heart and boiled for the cat—none of these would fit into Mrs.\nCrane’s long narrow body.\nShe seemed to grow taller and taller as she came nearer. When\nshe tiptoed up the steps, to us, crouched behind the currant bushes,\nshe seemed a giant.\nMy big sister opened the door to Mrs. Crane. They whispered.\nThen my sister came to us and said, “Children, kind Mrs. Crane is\ngoing to take you home with her until Mother is better.”\nAlice’s big eyes darkened with trouble. Obediently she picked up\nher doll and turned towards the house. I set my doll down with a\nspank, planted my feet wide apart and said, “Don’t want to go!”\nMy sister gave me an impatient shake. Mrs. Crane ahemmed.\nWe were scrubbed hard, and buttoned into our starchiest. Mrs.\nCrane took one of Alice’s hands and one of mine into a firm black kid\ngrip and marched us to the gate. While she opened the gate, she let\ngo of Alice’s hand but doubled her grip on mine. Her eyes were like\nbrown chocolate drops, hot and rich in colour when she looked at\nAlice, but when she looked at me they went cold and stale-looking.\nWe were hoisted up to the back seat of the dogcart. Father’s\nsplendid carpet bag with red roses on its sides and the great brass\nlock, was put under our feet to keep them from dangling. The bag\nwas full of clean frocks and handkerchiefs and hairbrushes.\nMrs. Crane climbed up in front beside Mr. Crane. His seat was half\na storey higher than hers. Mr. Crane cracked his whip and the yellow\nwheels spun furiously. Our house got smaller and smaller, then the\nroad twisted and it was gone altogether. The world felt enormous.\nWe crossed two bridges. Mud flats were under one and the gas-\nworks were under the other—they both smelt horrid. The horse’s\nhoofs made a deafening clatter on the bridges, and then they\npounded steadily on and on over the hard road. When at last we\ncame to the Crane’s house, it seemed as if we must have gone all\naround the world, and then somehow got there hind-before. You\npassed the Crane’s back gate first, and then you came to the front\ngate. The front door was on the back of the house. The house faced\nthe water, which looked like a river, but was really the sea and salt.\nYou went down the hill to the house and up the hill to the stable;\neverything was backwards to what i t was at home and made you feel\nlike Mother’s egg-timer turned over.\nMrs. Crane had three little girls. The two younger were the same\nage as Alice and I.\nThe three little Cranes ran out of the house when they heard us\ncome. They kissed Mama politely and, falling on Papa, hugged him\nlike bears.\nA man came to lead the horse away. The little Cranes were all\nbusy guessing what was in the parcels that came from under the\nseat of the dogcart, but the receding clop! clop! of the horse’s hoofs,\nhammered desolation into the souls of Alice and me.\nThe Crane’s hall was big and warm and dark, except for the glow\nfrom a large heater, which pulled out shiny things like the noses of\na lot of guns hanging in a rack on the wall and the fire irons and the\nstair rods. It picked out the brass lock of Father’s bag and the poor\nglassy eyes of stuffed bear and wolves and owls and deer. Helen saw\nme looking at them as we went upstairs and said, “My Papa shot all\nthose.”\n“What for?”\nHelen stared at me. “What f or? Doesn’t your Papa go in for sport?”\n“What is sport, Helen?”\nHelen considered. “Why it’s—killing things just for fun, not\nbecause you are hungry, chasing things with dogs and shooting\nthem.”\n“My Father does not do that.”\n“My Papa is a crack shot,” boasted Helen.\nAlice and I had a grown-up bedroom. One window looked over the\nwater and had a window-seat. The other window looked into a little\npine wood. There was a pair of beautiful blue china candlesticks on\nthe mantlepiece.\nWe children had nursery tea. Mrs. Crane had Grace the biggest\ngirl pour tea and Grace was snobbish. After tea we went into the\ndrawing-room.\nMrs. Crane’s drawing-room was a most beautiful room. There was\na big three-cornered piano in it, two sofas and a lot of lazy chairs\nfor lolling in. At home only Father and Mother sat in easy chairs:\nthey did not think it was good for little girls to sit on any kind\nbut straight up-and-down chairs of wood or cane. Mrs. Crane’s lazy\nchairs were fat and soft and were dressed up in shiny stuff with\nrosebuds sprinkled all over it. But bowls of real roses everywhere\nmade the cloth ones look foolish and growing ones poking their pink\nfaces into the open windows were best of all and smelled lovely. A\nbright little fire burned in the grate and kept the little sea breeze\nfrom being too cold and the breeze kept the fire from being too hot.\nIn front of the fire was a big fur rug; a brown-and-white dog was\nsprawled out upon it.\nWhen we five little girls trooped into the drawing-room, I thought\nthat the dog was the only creature in the room. Then I saw the top\nof Mr. Crane’s head and his slippers sticking out above and below\na mound of newspapers in an easy chair on one side of the fire.\nOn the other side the fire lit up Mrs. Crane’s hands folded in her\nlap. Her face was hidden behind a beaded drape hanging from a\nbrass rod which shaded her eyes from the fire-light. One hand lifted\nand patted a stool at her knee—this Helen went and sat on. Mrs.\nCrane’s lap was deep and should have been splendid to sit in, but her\nlittle girls never sat there. Helen said it was because Mama’s heart\nwas weak and I said, “But Helen, I thought big things were always\nstrong?”\nHelen did not know what I meant, because of course she had not\nheard those ladies discussing her Mother’s heart and so she did not\nknow what I knew about it.\nMrs. Crane told “Gracie dear”, to play one of her “pieces” on the\npiano. She always added dear to her children’s names as if it was a\npart of them.\nMary Crane and our Alice were shy little girls. They sat on the\nsofa with their dolls in their laps. Their eyes stared like the dolls’\neyes. Mrs. Crane would not allow dolls to be dressed or undressed\nin the drawing-room; she said it was not nice. I sat on the edge\nof a chair till it tipped, then I found myself in the very best place\nin all the room—right down on the fur rug beside the dog. When I\nput my head down on his side, he thumped his tail and a lovely live\nquiver ran through his whole body. I had meant to fight off sleep\nbecause of that strange bed upstairs, but the fire was warm and the\ndog comforting . . . I couldn’t think whose far-off voice it was saying,\n“Come to bed, children,” or whose hand it was shaking me.\nThe cold upstairs woke us up. Mrs. Crane looked black and tall\nstanding by the mantlepiece lighting the blue candles. The big room\nran away into dark corners. The bed was turned down and our\nnighties were ready, but we did not seem to know what to do next\nunless it was to cry. Mrs. Crane did not seem to know what to do\neither, so she said, “Perhaps you little girls would like to come into\nmy little girls’ room while they undress?” So we sat on their ottoman\nand watched. They brushed themselves a great deal—their hair and\nnails and teeth. They folded their clothes and said their prayers\ninto Mrs. Crane’s front, then stepped into bed very politely. Mrs.\nCrane told them to lie on their right sides, keep their mouths shut\nand breathe through their noses, then she threw the windows up\nwide. The wind rushed in, sputtered the candle and swept between\nMrs. Crane’s kisses and the children’s foreheads. Then she blew the\ncandle gently as if she was trying to teach the wind manners.\nBack in our room, Mrs. Crane said something about “undoing\nbuttons”. I backed up to Alice very quickly and she told Mrs. Crane\nthat we could undo each other.\n“Very well,” said Mrs. Crane, “I’ll come back and put out the candle\npresently.”\nWe scurried into bed, pulled the covers up over our heads and lay\nvery still.\nShe came and stood beside the two white mounds for a\nsecond—then two gentle puffs, the up-screech of the window, long\nsoft footsteps receding down the hall.\nTwo heads popped up from the covers.\n“Weren’t you scared she’d kiss us?”\n“Awfully! Or that she’d want to hear our prayers?”\n“The Crane girls are very religious.”\n“How’d you know?”\n“They said two verses of ‘Now I lay me’. We only know one.”\nAlice always slept quickly and beautifully. I tossed every way and\ndid not sleep, till all my troubles were pickled away in tears.\nAt breakfast while Mrs. Crane was busy with the tea-cups I got\nthe first chance of staring at her hard. The light was good and she\nwas much lower, sitting. She talked to Mr. Crane as she poured the\ntea, using big polite words in a deep voice. The words rolled round\nher wisdom teeth before they came out. Her hair, skin and dress\nwere brown like her eyes. Her heart could not help being in the right\nplace, it was clasped so tight by her corset and her brown stuff-\ndress was stretched so taut above that and buttoned from chin to\nwaist. Her heart certainly could not be a wide one. Her hands were\nclean and strong, with big knuckles. The longer I looked at Mrs.\nCrane the less I liked her. But I did like a lot of her things—the vase\nin the middle of the dining-room table for instance. Helen called it\nMama’s “epergne”. I t was a two-storey thing of glass and silver and\nwas always full of choice flowers, pure white geraniums that one\nlonged to stroke and kiss to see if they were real, fat begonias and\nbig heavy-headed fuchsias. Flowers loved Mrs. Crane and grew for\nher.\nMrs. Crane’s garden was not as tidy as Father’s but the flowers\nhad a good time and were not so prim. Mrs. Crane was lenient with\nher flowers. She let the wild ones scramble up and down each side\nof the clay path that ran down the bank to the sea. They jumbled\nthemselves up like dancers—roses and honeysuckle climbed\neverywhere. The front drive, which was really behind the house, was\ncircular and enclosed a space filled with fruit trees and raspberry\ncanes. The vegetable garden was in the front and the flowerbeds in\nthe back, because, of course, the front of the house was at the back.\nThere was a little croquet lawn too and the little pine wood that our\nbedroom looked out on.\nIn the middle of this wood was a large platform with lots of dog-\nkennels on it—to these Mr. Crane’s hunting dogs were chained.\nThe dogs did not know anything about women or girls and Mrs.\nCrane did not like them. Mr. Crane would not let the children handle\nthem; he said it spoilt them for hunting. I wanted to go to them\ndreadfully but Helen said that I must not. The children were allowed\nto have the old one who had been in the drawing-room because he\nwas no good for hunting.\nHelen said, “Once I had a little black dog. I loved him very much,\nbut Papa said he was a mongrel. So he got his gun and shot him.\nWhen the little dog saw the gun pointed at him he sat up and\nbegged. The shot went through his heart, but he still sat up with the\nbeg frozen in his paws.”\n“Oh Helen, how could your father? Why didn’t your mother stop\nhim?”\n“It did not make any difference to Mama. It was not her dog.”\nIn our house nobody would have thought of telling Father “not\nto”. Nor would we have thought of meddling with Father’s things. In\nthe Cranes’ home it was different. When Helen took me into a funny\nlittle room built all by itself in the garden and said, “This is Papa’s\nDen,” I was frightened and said, “Oh Helen! surely we ought not to.”\nThere was not a single woman’s thing in the Den. There were\nguns and fishing rods and wading boots and there was a desk with\npapers and lots of big books. There was a bottle of quicksilver. Helen\nuncorked it and poured it onto the table. It did amazing things,\nbreaking itself to bits and then joining itself together again, but\npresently it rolled off the table and we could not find it. Whenever\nMr. Crane came home after that, I was in terror for fear he would\nask about the quicksilver and I hated him because he had shot the\nlittle begging dog.\nThe little Cranes never took liberties with Mama’s things.\nIt seemed years since we left home, but neither Alice nor I had\nhad a birthday and there had been only one Sunday at Mrs. Crane’s.\nThere was one splendid thing though and that was Cricket. He was\na pinto pony belonging to the children. Every day he was saddled\nand we rode him in turns. The older girls rode in a long habit.\nHelen’s legs and mine were too young to be considered improper by\nMrs. Crane. So our frillies flapped joyously. Helen switched Cricket\nto make him go fast, but fast or slow were alike to me. It was a\ndelight to feel his warm sides against my legs. The toss of his mane,\nthe switch of his tail, his long sighs and short snorts, the delicious\ntickle of his lips when you fed him sugar—everything about him was\nentrancing, even the horsy smell. Just the thought of Cricket, when\nyou were crying yourself to sleep, helped.\nThere was no more room for Cricket in Mrs. Crane’s heart than\nthere was for the dogs, but Mrs. Crane’s heart did take in an old\nlady called Mrs. Miles. Mrs. Miles was almost deaf and almost blind.\nShe wore a lace cap and a great many shawls and she knitted and\nblinked, knitted and blinked, all day. She came to stay with Mrs.\nCrane while we were there. Mrs. Miles liked fresh raspberries for\nher breakfast and to make up for being nearly blind and nearly deaf,\nMrs. Crane gave her everything she could that she was fond of. We\nchildren had to get up earlier to pick raspberries and Mrs. Crane did\nnot even mind if our fresh frocks got wetted with dew, because she\nwanted to comfort Mrs. Miles for being old and deaf and blind.\nOn Sunday afternoon Mrs. Miles draped her fluffiest shawl over\nher cap and face and everything and presently big snores came\nstraining through it. Mr. Crane’s newspaper was sitting on top of\nhis bald spot and he was snoring too—the paper flapped in and out\nabove his mouth. Mr. Crane’s “awk, awk” and Mrs. Miles’ “eek, eek”\nwouldn’t keep step and we little girls giggled.\nMrs. Crane said, “It is very rude for little girls to laugh at their\nelders.”\nHelen asked, “Even at their snores, Mama?”\n“Even at their snores,” said Mrs. Crane. She hushed us into the far\ncorner of the drawing-room and read us a very dull story.\nHelen on the stool at her mother’s knee and the three others on\nthe sofa were all comfortable enough to shut their eyes and forget,\nbut how could anyone on a three-legged stool under the high top of\nthe sofa sleep? Especially if the fringe of an antimacassar lolled over\nthe top and tickled your neck? My fingers reached up to the little\ntails of wool bunched in colours and began to plait—red, yellow,\nblack, red, yellow, black. A neat little row of pigtails hung there when\nthe story was done and I thought it looked fine.\nWhen we trooped down the stairs next morning, Mrs. Crane was\nwaiting at the foot. Her teeth looked very long, the chocolate of her\neyes very stale. From the upper landing we must have looked like a\nlong caterpillar following her to the drawing-room.\nOf course she knew it was me, because she had told me to sit\nthere, but she put me through five separate agonies, her pointing\nfinger getting longer and her voice deeper, with every “Did you do\nit?” When it came to me, her finger touched the antimacassar and\nher voice dragged me into a deep pit. When I said my, “Yes, Mrs.\nCrane,” she said that I had desecrated the work of her dear dead\nmother’s hands, that i t was Satan that had told my idle fingers to do\nit, that I was a naughty mischievous child and that after breakfast I\nmust undo all the little pigtails.\nNot the boom of the breakfast gong, nor the bellow of Mr. Crane’s\nfamily prayers, nor the leather cushion that always smelt so real\nand nice when your nose went into it, could drown those horrid\nsobs. They couldn’t be swallowed nor would they let my breakfast\npass them. So Mrs. Crane excused me and I went to the beastly\nantimacassar and wished her mother had taken it to Heaven with\nher. Mrs. Miles came and sat near and blinked and clicked, blinked\nand clicked.\n“Please! Please! Mrs. Crane, can’t we go home?”\n“And make your poor Mama worse?”\nI did not even want to ride Cricket that day.\nAfter tea we went to visit a friend of Mrs. Crane’s. We went in the\nboat. Mr. Crane rowed. Night came. Under the bridges the black was\nthick and the traffic thundered over our heads. Then we got into a\nboom of loose logs. They bumped our boat and made it shiver and\nwhen Mr. Crane stood up and pushed them away with his oar, i t\ntipped. Helen and I were one on each side of Mrs. Crane in the stern.\nWhen she pulled one tiller rope her elbow dug into me, when she\npulled the other her other elbow dug into Helen.\nThe ropes rattled in and out and the tiller squeaked. I began to\nshake and my teeth to chatter.\n“Stop it, child!” said Mrs. Crane.\nBut I could not stop. I stared down into the black water and shook\nand shook and was deadly cold.\nMrs. Crane said I must have taken a chill. I had not eaten anything\nall day, so she gave me a large dose of castor oil when we got home.\nI f elt dreadfully bad, especially in bed, when Alice said, “Why can’t\nyou behave? You’ve annoyed Mrs. Crane all day.”\n“I hate her! I hate her!” I cried. “She’s got a pig’s heart.”\nAlice hitched the bedclothes over her\nshoulder and immediately long breaths came from her.\nNext morning was wet, but about noon there was meek sunshine\nand Helen and I were sent to run up and down the drive.\nEverything was so opposite at Mrs. Crane’s that sometimes you\nhad to feel your head to be sure you were not standing on it. For\ninstance you could do all sorts of things in the garden, climb trees\nand swing on gates. It was not even wicked to step on a flower bed.\nBut it was naughty to play in the stable yard among the creatures,\nor to tumble in the hay in the loft, or to lift a chicken, or to hold a\npuppy. Every time we came to the stable end of the drive, I just had\nto stop and talk to Cricket through the bars and peer into his great\nbig eyes and whisper into his ears.\nIn the yard behind Cricket I saw a hen.\n“Oh Helen just look at that poor hen! How bad she does feel!”\n“How do you know she feels bad?”\n“Well, look at her shut eyes and her head and tail and wings all\nflopped. She feels as I did yesterday. Maybe oil . . .”\n“I’ll pour if you’ll hold,” said Helen.\nWe took the hen to the nursery. She liked the holding, but was\nangry at the pouring. When her throat was full she flapped free. I did\nnot know a hen could fly so high. She knocked several things over\nand gargled the oil in her throat, then her big muddy feet clutched\nthe top of the bookcase and she spat the oil over Mrs. Crane’s books\nso that she could cackle. She had seemed so meek and sick we\ncould not believe it. I was still staring when I heard a little squashed\n“Mama” come from Helen, as if something had crushed it out of her.\nSometimes I have thought that Mrs. Crane had the power to grow\nand shrivel at will. She filled the room, her eyes burnt and her voice\nfroze.\n“Catch that fowl!”\nAs I mounted the chair to catch the hen, I saw what her muddy\nfeet and the oil had done to me. Helen’s hair was long and she could\nhide behind it, but mine was short. I stepped carefully over the\nhateful blue bottle oozing sluggishly over the rug.\nOut on the drive I plunged my burning face down into the fowl’s\nsoft feathers.\n“Oh, old hen, I wish I could shrivel and get under your wing!” I\ncried. I had to put her down and go back alone.\nIt seemed almost as if I had shrivelled, I felt so shamed and small\nwhen I saw Mrs. Crane on her knees scrubbing the rug.\nI went close. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Crane.”\nNo answer. I went closer. “I wanted to help your hen. She’s better.\nPerhaps it was only a little cuddling she wanted.”\nOh, why didn’t she speak! Why didn’t she scold or even smack, not\njust scrub, scrub, scrub!\nI stood looking down at Mrs. Crane. I had never seen the top of\nher before. I saw the part of her hair, the round of her shoulders, her\nbroad back, her thickness when you saw her from on top. Perhaps\nafter all there was room for quite a wide heart.\nSuddenly now while I could reach her, I wanted to put my arms\nround her and cry.\nMrs. Crane rose so suddenly that she almost trod on me. I stepped\nback. The wings of her nose trembled. Mrs. Crane was smelling.\nShe strode to the doll cupboard and doubled down into it. When\nshe backed out, a starfish dangled from the tips of the fingers of\neach hand. Helen and I had caught some under the boathouse ten\ndays before and dressed them up in dolls’ clothes. Mrs. Crane’s nose\nand hands were as far as they could get away from each other.\nMrs. Crane looked at me hard. “Such things never enter my\nHelen’s head,” she said. “Your mama is better; they are coming for\nyou tonight.”\nIn spite of the bad-smell-nose she wore, and the disgust in her\nfingertips, Mrs. Crane seemed to me just then a most beautiful\nwoman.\n“Oh, Mrs. Crane!”\nMy hands trembled up in that silly way pieces of us have of doing\non their own, but the rest of me pulled them down quickly before\nMrs. Crane saw."

      "title": "White Currants",
      "content": "It happened many times, and it always happened just in that corner\nof the old garden.\nWhen it was going to happen, the dance in your feet took you\nthere without your doing anything about it. You danced through the\nflower garden and the vegetable garden till you came to the row of\ncurrant bushes, and then you danced down it.\nFirst came the black currants with their strong wild smell. Then\ncame the red currants hanging in bright tart clusters. On the very\nlast bush in the row the currants were white. The white currants\nripened first. The riper they got, the clearer they grew, till you could\nalmost see right through them. You could see the tiny veins in their\nskins and the seeds and the juice. Each currant hung there like an\nalmost-told secret.\nOh! you thought, if the currants were just a wee bit clearer, then\nperhaps you could see themliving, inside.\nThe white currant bush was the finish of the garden, and after it\nwas a little spare place before you came to the fence. Nobody ever\ncame there except to dump garden rubbish.\nBursting higgledy-piggledy up through the rubbish everywhere,\ngrew a half-wild mauvy-pink flower. The leaves and the blossoms\nwere not much to look at, because it poured every drop of i ts glory\ninto its smell. When you went there the colour and the smell took\nyou and wrapped you up in themselves.\nThe smell called the bees and the butterflies from ever so far. The\nwhite butterflies liked it best; there were millions of them flickering\namong the pink flowers, and the hum of the bees never stopped.\nThe sun dazzled the butterflies’ wings and called the smell out\nof the flowers. Everything trembled. When you went in among the\nmauvy-pink flowers and the butterflies you began to tremble too;\nyou seemed to become a part of it—and then what do you think\nhappened? Somebody else was there too. He was on a white horse\nand he had brought another white horse for me.\nWe flew round and round in and out among the mauvy-pink\nblossoms, on the white horses. I never saw the boy; he was there\nand I knew his name, but who gave it to him or where he came from\nI did not know. He was different from other boys, you did not have to\nsee him, that was why I liked him so. I never saw the horses either,\nbut I knew that they were there and that they were white.\nIn and out, round and round we went. Some of the pink flowers\nwere above our heads with bits of blue sky peeping through, and\nbelow us was a mass of pink. None of the flowers seemed quite\njoined to the earth—you only saw their tops, not where they went\ninto the earth.\nEverything was going so fast—the butterflies’ wings, the pink\nflowers, the hum and the smell, that they stopped being four things\nand became one most lovely thing, and the little boy and the white\nhorses and I were in the middle of i t, like the seeds that you saw\ndimly inside the white currants. In fact, the beautiful thing was like\nthe white currants, like a big splendid secret getting clearer and\nclearer every moment—just a second more and——.\n“Come and gather the white currants,” a grown-up voice called\nfrom the vegetable garden.\nThe most beautiful thing fell apart. The bees and the butterflies\nand the mauvy-pink flowers and the smell, stopped being one and\nsat down in their own four places. The boy and the horses were\ngone.\nThe grown-up was picking beans. I took the glass dish.\n“If we left the white currants, wouldn’t they ripen a little more?\nWouldn’t they get—clearer?”\n“No, they would shrivel.”\n“Oh!”\nThen I asked, “What is the name of that mauvy-pink flower?”\n“Rocket.”\n“Rocket?”\n“Yes—the same as the fireworks.”\nRockets! Beautiful things that tear up into the air and burst!"

      "title": "The Orange Lily",
      "content": "Henry Mitchell’s nursery garden was set with long rows of trees,\nshrubs and plants. It sat on the edge of the town. In one corner of i ts\nacreage was the little grey cottage where Henry and his wife, Anne,\nlived. They were childless and well on in years, trying honestly to\nchoke down homesickness and to acclimatize themselves as well as\ntheir Old Country plants to their step-land.\nSmall came into the nursery garden taking the gravel path at a\ngallop, the steps at a jump, tiptoeing to reach the doorbell—then\nshe turned sharp against the temptation of peering through the\ncoloured glass at the door-sides to see sombre Anne Mitchell come\ndown the hall multicoloured—green face, red dress, blue hair. The\nturn brought Small face to face with the Orange Lily.\nThe lily grew in the angle made by the front of the house and the\nside of the porch. Small’s knees doubled to the splintery porch floor.\nShe leaned over to look into the lily’s trumpet, stuck out a finger to\nfeel the petals. They had not the greasy feel of the wax lilies they\nresembled, they had not the smooth hard shininess of china. They\nwere cool, slippery and alive.\nLily rolled her petals grandly wide as sentinelled doors roll back\nfor royalty. The entrance to her trumpet was guarded by a group of\nrust-powdered stamens—her powerful perfume pushed past these.\nWhat was in the bottom of Lily’s trumpet? What was it that the\nstamens were so carefully guarding? Small pushed the stamens\naside and looked. The trumpet was empty—the emptiness of a\nchurch after parson and people have gone, when the music is asleep\nin the organ and the markers dangle from the Bible on the lectern.\nAnne Mitchell opened the cottage door.\n“Come see my everlasting flowers, Small—my flowers that never\ndie.”\nWith a backward look Small said, “What a lovely lily!”\n“Well enough but strong-smelling, gaudy. Come see the\neverlastings.”\nThe front room of the cottage was empty; newspapers were\nspread over the floor and heaped with the crisping everlasting\nflowers, each colour in a separate pile. The sunlight in the room was\ndulled by drawn white blinds. The air was heavy—dead, dusty as the\nair of a hay loft.\nThe flowers crackled at Anne’s touch. “Enough to wreathe the\nwinter’s dead,” she said with a happy little sigh and, taking a pink\nbud from the pile, twined it in the lace of her black cap. It drooped\nagainst her thin old cheek that was nearly as pink, nearly as dry as\nthe flower.\n“Come, Mrs. Gray’s wreath!” She took Small to the sitting-room.\nHalf of Mrs. Gray’s wreath was on the table, Anne’s cat, an invalid\nguinea hen and Henry huddled round the stove. The fire and the\nfunereal everlastings crackled cheerfully.\nPresently Small said, “I had better go now.”\n“You shall have a posy,” said Anne, laying down the wreath.\n“Will there be enough for Mrs. Gray and me too?” asked Small.\n“We will gather flowers from the garden for you.”\nThe Orange Lily! Oh if Mrs. Mitchell would only give me the\nOrange Lily! Oh, if only I could hold it in my hand and look and look!\nAnne passed the lily. Beyond was the bed of pinks—white, clove,\ncinnamon.\n“Smell like puddings, don’t they?” said Small.\n“My dear!”\nAnne’s scissors chawed the wiry stems almost as sapless as the\neverlastings. Life seemed to have rushed to the heads of the pinks\nand flopped them face down to the ground. Anne blew off the dust\nas she bunched the pinks. Small went back to the lily. With pocket-\nhandkerchief she wiped the petals she had rusted by pushing aside\nthe stamens.\n“There are four more lilies to come, Mrs. Mitchell!”\nAnne lifted the corner of her black silk apron.\n“That lily has rusted your nose, Small.”\nShe scrubbed.\nSmall went home.\n“Here’s pinks,” she said, tossing the bunch upon the table.\nIn her heart she hugged an Orange Lily. I t had burned itself there\nnot with flaming petals, not through the hot, rich smell. Soundless,\nformless, white—it burned there."

      "title": "How Lizzie was Shamed Right Through",
      "content": "Now that I am eight, the same age that Lizzie was when the party\nhappened, and am getting quite near to being grown-up, I can see\nhow shamed poor Lizzie must have been of me then.\nNow I know why the Langleys, who were so old, gave a party\nfor us who were so little, but then I was only four so I did not\nwonder about it at all, nor notice that the fair, shy boy was their own\nlittle brother, hundreds and hundreds of years younger than his big\nbrother and two big sisters. They did not poke his party in the little\nboy’s face, did not say, “ Albert, this is your party. You must be kind\nand polite to the boys and girls.” That would have made Albert shyer\nthan he was already. They let him enjoy his own party just as the\nother children were enjoying it.\nThe Langleys’ party was the first one we had ever been to. Mother\nmade us look very nice. We had frilly white dresses, very starched.\nLizzie who was eight, and Alice who was six, had blue sashes and\nhair ribbons. There was pink ribbon on me and I was only four.\nSister Dede bustled round saying, “Hurry! Hurry!” scrubbing\nfinger nails and polishing shoes. She knotted our ribbons very\ntightly so that we should not lose them,—they pulled the little hairs\nunder our curls and made us “ooch” and wriggle. Then Dede gave\nus little smacks and called us boobies. The starch in the trimming\nabout our knees was very scratchy. Dede snapped the white elastics\nunder our chins as she put on our hats and said to Mother, “I wonder\nhow long these youngsters will stay clean.” Being fixed up for the\nparty was very painful.\nThere were three pairs of white cotton gloves waiting on the hall\nstand, like the mitts of the three little kittens. Mother sorted them\nand stroked them onto the fingers we held out as stiff as they’d\ngo, and by the time that Mr. Russell’s hansom-cab, the only one in\nVictoria, jingled up to the door, we were quite ready.\nMother kissed us. Dede kissed us.\n“Have you all got clean pocket handkerchiefs?”\nYes, we had.\n“Don’t forget to use them.”\nNo, we wouldn’t.\n“Be sure to thank Miss Langley for the nice time.”\n“S’pose it isn’t nice?”\n“Say ‘thank you’ even more politely.”\nWe sat in a row on the seat; Mr. Russell slammed the apron of the\ncab down in front of us, jumped up like a monkey to his perch at the\nback, and we were off—eight, six and four years old going to our first\nparty.\nIt was such fun sitting there and being taken by the horse, just\nas if he knew all by himself where to find parties for little girls, for,\nafter Mr. Russell had climbed up behind so that you could not see\nhim, you forgot that there was a driver.\nLizzie looked over my hat and said to Alice, “I do hope this child\nwill behave decently, don’t you? There! See, already!” She pointed to\nthe tips of my gloves which were all black from feeling the edges and\nbuttons of the cab’s inside.\n“Stop it, bad child,” she squealed so shrilly that a little door in the\nroof of the cab opened and Mr. Russell put his head in. When he saw\nit was only a “mad” squeal he took his head out again and shut up\nthe hole.\nWe drove a long way before we came to the Langleys’. Their\ngate did not know which road it liked best, Moss or Fairfield, so it\nstraddled the corner and gaped wide. We drove up to the door. The\ntwo Miss Langleys and Mr. Langley were there, shaking boys and\ngirls by the hands.\nThe three Langleys had been grown-up a long, long time. They\nhad big shining teeth which their lips hugged tight till smiles pushed\nthem back and then you saw how strong and white the teeth were.\nHow Lizzie was Shamed Right Through|65\nThey had yellow hair, blue eyes, and had to double down a long way\nto reach the children’s hands.\nMr. Russell flung back the apron of his cab but we still kept on\nsitting there in a close row like the three monkeys, “See no evil, hear\nno evil, and speak no evil.” He said, “Come now, little leddies. Me ’ oss\nand ’ansom baint inwited.” He lifted me out and Mr. Langley had to\npull the others from the cab, for now that we were in the middle of\nthe party Lizzie was as scared as any of us. She took Alice by one\nhand and me by the other and we shook hands with all the Langleys,\nfor no matter how scared Lizzie was she always did, and made us do,\nwhat she knew was right.\nThe house was the wide, sitting sort. Vines and creepers tied it\ndown to the ground.\nThe garden was big. It had trees, bushes and lawns—there were\nrocks covered with ivy, too.\nThe Langleys tried to mix the children by suggesting “hide and\nseek” among the bushes. Everybody hid but no one would seek. Each\nchild wanted to hold a hand belonging to another of i ts own family.\nThe boys were very, very shy and the girls’ clothes so starchy they\nrattled if they moved.\nBy and by Miss Langley counted . . . “Sixteen”, she said, “That is all\nwe have invited so we had better start.” Something was coming up\nthe drive. Lizzie thought i t was our cab and that Miss Langley meant\nthat i t was time to be going home, so she took us up to Miss Langley\nto say what Mother had told us to, but it was not Mr. Russell at all.\nIt was Mr. Winter’s big picnic carriage, all shiny and new, the one\nhe had got specially for taking children to parties and picnics. There\nseemed to be no end to the amount of children he could stuff into\nthis carriage, but there was, because, when they put me in, there\nwas not a crack of space left except the door handle, so I sat on that.\nThe boys were all up in the front seat, swarming over Mr. Winter like\nsparrows. Behind sat all the little girls—so still—so polite. Suddenly I\nhad a thought and cried, “If this door busted open I’d fall out!”\n“Millie, don’t say ‘busted’. I t’s horrible! Say ‘bursted’.” Lizzie’s face\nwas red with shame.\nWe went to Foul Bay and had games on the beach. After we had\nplayed a long time Lizzie was just as clean as when we left home,\nAlice was almost as clean, and I was all mussed up, but they were\nnot having half such a good time as I.\nWe went back to the Langleys’ house for tea. There were all sorts\nof sandwiches and there was cocoa and two kinds of cake—one just\nplain currant, the other a most beautiful cake with pink icing and\njelly.\nLizzie and Alice sat across the table from me and were being\nfrightfully polite, taking little nibbling bites like ladies, holding their\ncups with one hand, and never forgetting “thank you”.\nMy mug was big, it took both my hands. Even then it was heavy\nand slopped. Miss Langley said, “Oh, your pretty frock!” and tied a\nbib round me and pulled the little neck hairs so hard that I could\nnot help one or two squeaks . . . they weren’t big, but Lizzie scowled\nand whispered to Alice. I was sure she said, “Bad, dirty little thing.” I\nwas just going to make a face at her when Miss Kate Langley came\nwith the splendid pink cake. I had a piece of the currant kind on my\nplate. I was so afraid Miss Kate would see it and pass me—maybe she\nwould never come back—that I stuffed the currant cake into both\ncheeks and held my hand up as the girls did at lessons if they wanted\nsomething.\n“Jelly cake, dear?”\nI couldn’t speak, but I nodded. Lizzie’s forehead crinkled like\ncream when mother was skimming for butter. She mouthed across\nat me, “I’m going to tell.” My mouth was too busy to do anything\nwith, but I did the worst I could at her with my eyes and nose. She\nhad spoilt everything. Somehow the jelly cake was not half as nice as\nI thought it was going to be.\nThe moment tea was over Miss Langley took my bib off and,\nholding me by the wrists with my hands in the air, said:\n“Come, dear. Let me wash you before . . .”\nShe washed beautifully and was a lovely lady. I told her about my\ncat Tibby, and after she had washed my face she kissed it.\nI f elt very special going back to the others with my hand in that of\nthe biggest and best Miss Langley.\nOut on the lawn they were playing “Presents for shies.” Mr.\nLangley stuck up four wobbly poles and put a prize on top of\neach—bells and tops and whistles. If your shy hit a pole so that\na prize fell off, it was yours to keep. I wanted a whistle most\ndreadfully. When my turn came my shy flew right over the other\nside of the garden. I had been quite sure that I could knock the\nwhistle off the pole but my shy stick just would not do it. I had three\ntries and then I ran to Alice who was sitting on a bench and put my\nhead down in her lap and howled. She lifted me by the ribbon and\nspread her handkerchief under my face so that I should not spoil her\ndress. Miss Langley heard my crying.\n“There, there!” she said and gave me a little muslin bag with six\ncandies in it—but it was not a whistle.\nLizzie told Miss Langley that she was very ashamed of me and that\nI always did behave dreadfully at parties. That made me stop crying\nand shout, “I never, never went to one before.” Then I did make the\nvery worst face I knew how at Lizzie and gave two sweets to Alice,\ntwo to Miss Langley, two to myself, and threw the empty bag at\nLizzie as she went off to have her shy. I don’t know how I should\nhave felt if she had won a whistle but when she came back without\nany prize I picked up the bag and put the candy I was not eating in\nit and gave it to her.\nJingle, jingle, clop, clop—Mr. Russell’s cab was coming up the\ndrive. Again Lizzie marched us to Miss Langley.\n“Thank you for a very nice party, Miss Langley,” she said.\nThen she poked at Alice, but Alice only went red as a geranium!\nShe had forgotten what it was she had to say. Poor Lizzie looked\ndown at me and saw the spot of jelly, the cocoa and the front part\nof me where I’d gone under the bush after my shy stick. She pushed\nme back and pulled her own clean skirt across me quickly.\nWhen Lizzie wasn’t looking at her Alice could remember all right.\nShe said, “Miss Langley, I liked myself, and I’m glad I came.”\nMiss Langley gave her such a lovely smile that I tore my hand from\nLizzie’s, ran up and tiptoed, with my face as high as it would go, for\nMiss Langley to kiss.\nWe all jumped into the cab then and the apron slammed off\neverything but our heads and waving hands. The cab whisked round.\nThe party was gone.\n“Where’re your gloves?”\n“L-l-lost.”\n“Where’s your hankie?”\n“L—l—lost.”\nLizzie took out her own and nearly twisted the nose off my face.\n“I’m going to tell Mother about ‘busted’, about grabbing the jelly\ncake with your mouth full, about having to wear a bib and be\nwashed. Oh! and there’s the two lost things as well. I expect you’ll\nget spanked, you disgusting child. I’m shamed right through about\nyou, and I’m never, never, never going to take you to a party again.”\nOne of my eyes cried for tiredness and the other because I was\nmad.\nAlice got out her hankie, her very best one with Christmas scent\non it. “Keep it,” she whispered, pushing it into my hand. “Then\nthere’ll be only one lost thing instead of two.”"

      "content": "My sister Alice was two years older than I and knew a lot. Lizzie was\ntwo years older than Alice and thought she knew it all. My great big\nsister did know everything. Mother knew all about God. Father knew\nall about the earth. I knew more than our baby, but I was always\nwondering and wondering.\nSome wonders started inside you just like a stomach-ache. Some\nstarted in outside things when you saw, smelled, heard or felt them.\nThe wonder tickled your thinking—coming from nowhere it got into\nyour head running round and round inside until you asked a grown-\nup about this particular wonder and then it stopped bothering you.\nLizzie, Alice and I were playing in the garden when our Chinaboy\nBoy came down the path—that is how I know exactly what time of\nevening it was that this new noise set me wondering, because Bong\nwas very punctual. The tassel on the end of his pigtail waggled all\ndown the path and, as he turned out of the gate, it gave a special\nlittle flip. Then you knew that i t was almost bed-time. It was just as\nthe slip-slop of Bong’s Chinese shoes faded away that I first noticed\nthat new noise.\nFirst it was just a little bunch of grating snaps following each other\nvery quickly, as if someone were dragging a stick across a picket\nfence as he ran. The rattles got quicker and quicker, more and more,\ntill it sounded as if millions of sticks were being dragged across\nmillions of fences.\nI said, “Listen girls! What is it?”\nAlice said she did not hear anything in particular.\nLizzie said, “It’s just Spring noises, silly!”\nFirstthesoundwouldseemhere,thenthere,then\neverywhere—suddenly it would stop dead and then the stillness\nstartled you, but soon the rattles would clatter together again filling\nthe whole world with the most tremendous racket, all except just\nwhere you stood.\nI was glad when my big sister put her head out of the window and\ncalled, “Bed-time, children!” I wanted to pull the covers up over my\nhead and shut out the noise.\nWe went into the sitting-room to kiss Father and Mother good\nnight. The fire and the lamp were lighted. Mother was\nsewing—Father looked at her over the top of his newspaper and said:\n“Listen to British Columbia’s nightingale, Mother! Spring has\ncome.”\nMother replied, “Yes, he certainly does love Spring in the Beacon\nHill skunk-cabbage swamp!”\n“Come along, children!” called Big Sister.\nUpstairs our bedroom was full of the noise. It came pouring in\nthrough the dormer window. When the candle was taken away it\nseemed louder because of the dark. I called to Big Sister as she went\ndown the stair, “Please may we have the window shut?”\n“Certainly not! Stuffy little girl! The night is not cold.”\n“It isn’t the cold, it’s the noise.”\n“Noise? Fiddlesticks! Go to sleep.”\nI nosed close to Alice, “Do you know what nightingales are Alice?”\n“Some sort of creature.”\n“They must be simplyenormous to make such a big noise.”\nAlice’s “uh-huh” was sleep talk.\nI lay trying to “size” the nightingale by its noise. Our piano even\nwith sister Edith pounding her hardest could never fill the whole\nnight like that. Our cow was bigger than the piano, but even when\nthey shut her calf away from her and great moos made her sides\ngo in and out, her bellows only rumbled round the yard. This\nnightingale’s voice crackled through the woods, the sky and\neverywhere. The band that played in the Queen’s birthday parade\ndied when you lost sight of i t. This sound of something which you\ncould not see at all filled the world. Why, e ven the cannon that went\noff at Esquimalt for people to set their watches by every night at\nnine-thirty and made Victoria’s windows rattle, went silent after one\ngreat bang, but this monster in Beacon Hill Park adjoining our own\nproperty kept on and on with its roar of crackles.\nI knew now why we were never allowed to go into Beacon Hill\nswamp to gather spring flowers: it was not on account of the mud\nat all, but because of this nightingale monster.\n“I shall never, never go into Beacon Hill Park again,” I said to\nmyself. “I won’t let on I’m scared, but when we go for a walk I shall\nsay, ‘Let’s go to the beach, it’s much nicer than the Park.’”\nI thought, “Perhaps she comes to the Park like the birds to nest\nin the Spring. Perhaps the Park might be safe in winter when the\nMonster went south.”\nI heard Father shoot the front-door bolt and the grown-ups\ncoming up the stair. As the candles flickered past our door I\nwhispered, “Mother!”\nShe came to me.\n“Why are you not asleep?”\n“Mother, how big is a nightingale?”\n“Nightingales are small birds, we do not have them in Victoria.”\nBirds!—None in Victoria!\n“But Father said—”\n“That was just a joke, calling our little green frogs nightingales. Go\nto sleep, child.”\nDear little hopping frogs!—I slept."

      "content": "Father was a stern straight man. Straight legs and shoulders;\nstraight side-trim to his beard, the ends of which were straight-cut\nacross his chest. From under heavy eyebrows his look was direct,\nthough once in a rare while a little twinkle forced its way through.\nThen something was likely to happen.\nOur family had to whiz around Father like a top round its peg.\nIt was Sunday. Father was carving the saddle of mutton.\nEverybody was helped. Father’s plate had gone up for vegetables.\nUncle and Auntie Hays were visiting us from San Francisco.\nFather’s twinkle ran up the table to Mother and zig-zagged back,\nskipping Auntie, who was fixing her napkin over her large front with\na diamond pin.\nFather said, “What about a picnic on Saturday, Mother? We will\nhave the omnibus and go to Mill Stream.”\nThe two big sisters, we three little girls and the small brother\nwere glad. Mother beamed on us all. Auntie attended to her mutton.\nUncle never did have anything to say. He was like the long cushion\nin the church pew—made to be sat on.\nAll week we stared at the clock, but, for all she ticked, her hands\nstuck; it took ages for her to register even a minute. But Saturday\ndid come at last and with it, sharp at ten, the yellow bus.\nUncle Hays made a nest of cushions in one corner of the bus\nfor Auntie. Pies and cakes, white-wrapped and tucked into baskets\nlike babies, the tea-billy wrapped in a newspaper petticoat—all were\nloaded in and we took our places and rattled away.\nThe bus had two horses and carpet seats. Its wheels were iron-\nbound and made a terrible racket over the stones.\nOnly the very middle of our town was paved and sprinkled;\nbeyond the town was dust and bumps.\nThe seats of the bus were high. We three little girls discovered\nthat we bumped less if we did not dangle, so we knelt on the seat\nand rested our arms on the open window ledges, till Auntie told\nUncle he must shut all the windows except one, or the dust would\nruin her new dust coat. After that we dangled and bumped.\nAuntie grumbled all the way about Victoria’s poor little blue\nwater-barrel cart, that could only do the middle of the town, and\ntold us of the splendid water-wagons of San Francisco.\nAt last we drove through a gate and down a lane and stopped. The\ndriver opened the door and we all spilled out onto the grass beside\na beautiful stream.\nUncle built a new nest for Auntie. There were pine boughs as well\nas pillows to it now, and she looked like a great fat bird sitting there\npeeping and cooing at uncle over the edge.\nThe table-cloth was spread on the grass close to Auntie’s nest. As\nsoon as lunch was over Mother said, “Now children, run along. Don’t\ngo into the thick woods, keep by the stream.”\nFather looked at his watch and said, “It’s now one o’clock—you\nhave till five.”\nDownwards the stream broadened into a meadow; upstream it\nbored a green tunnel through the forest, a tunnel crooked as a\nbed-spring. It curled round and round because there were so many\nboulders and trees and dams in the way. The sides of the tunnel\nwere forest, the top overhanging trees, the floor racing water.\nWe could not have squeezed into the woods had we tried because\nthey were so thick, and we could not have seen where to put our\nfeet, nor could we have seen over the top, because the undergrowth\nwas so high.\nEvery twist the stream took it sang a different tune and kept\ndifferent time. It would rush around the corner of a great boulder\nand pour bubbling into a still pool, lie there pretending it had come\nto be still, but all the time it was going round and round as if it\nwas learning to write “O’s”; then it would pour itself smoothly over\na wedged log and go purling over the pebbles, quiet and dreamy.\nSuddenly it would rush for another turn, and roar into a rocky basin\ntrickling out of that again into a wide singing place. It had to do all\nthese queer things and use force and roughness to get by some of\nthe obstacles. But sometimes the stream was very gentle, and its\nround stones were covered with a fine brown moss. When the moss\nwas wet i t looked just like babies’ hair. You could pretend the stones\nwere babies in their bath and the stream was sponging water over\ntheir heads.\nFive-finger maidenhair ferns grew all along the banks. Some of\nthem spread their thin black arms over the edge and, dipping their\nfingers in the water, washed them gently to and fro. Then the wind\nlifted them and tossed them in the air like thousands of waving\nhands. All kinds of mosses grew by the stream—tufty, f lat, ferny, and\ncurly, green, yellow and a whitish kind that was tipped with scarlet\nsealing wax.\nYellow eyes of musk blossoms peeped from crannies. They had\na thick, soft smell. The smell of the earth was rich. The pines and\nthe cedars smelled spicy. The wind mixed all the smells into a great,\ngrand smell that made you love everything. There were immense\nsober pines whose tops you could not see, and little pines, fluffed\nout ready to dance. The drooping boughs of the cedars formed a\nthatch so thick and tight that creatures could shelter under it no\nmatter how hard it rained. The bushes did not grow tight to the\ncedars because it was too dry and dark under them. Even their own\nlower limbs were red-brown and the earth bare underneath.\nThe wind sauntered up the stream bumping into everything. It\nwas not strong enough to sweep boldly up the tunnel, but quivered\nalong, giving bluffs and boulders playful little whacks before turning\nthe next corner and crumpling the surface of that pool.\nThere was much to see as we went up the river, and we went\nslowly because there were so many things to get over and under.\nSometimes there were little rims of muddy beach, pocked with the\ndent of deer hooves. Except for the stream the place was very quiet.\nIt was like the stillness of a bird held in the hand with just its heart\nthrobbing.\nSometimes a kingfisher screamed or a squirrel scolded and made\nyou jump. I heard a plop down at my feet—it was a great golden-\nbrown toad. I took him in my hands.\nOne sister said, “Ugh!” The other said, “Warts”.\nI put him in a tin and weighted it with a stone and hid it under a\nskunk-cabbage.\nWe were very, very far up the stream, though it had not seemed\na long way at all, when our big sister came around the bend behind\nus.\n“Come children,” she called. “It is time to go home.”\nWe looked at each other. What did she mean? Time to go home?\nWe had only just come.\nI faced about.\n“It is not,” I said rudely, and received a smart box on the ear. But it\nwas not our sister’s word we doubted, it was Time.\nI lagged behind to pick up the toad, wondering deeply about Time.\nWhat was Time anyway, that things could play such tricks with it?\nA stream could squeeze a whole afternoon into one minute. A clock\ncould spread one week out into a whole year.\nThe baskets were packed. Uncle was building another nest for\nAuntie. Mother was seated in the bus looking very tired. Dick was\nasleep on the seat with his head in Mother’s lap and his toy watch\ndangling out of his pocket.\nI stared at the watch hard. The hands were at the same place they\nwere when we started in the morning. Play things were always truer\nthan real.\nThe bus started bumping along and the dust rolled behind. I sat\nopposite Auntie. I had draped a skunk-cabbage leaf over the toad’s\ntin.\n“See dear, you will have to throw that leaf out of the window; the\nsmell of i t upsets Auntie.” She detested me, and always tacked on\nthat hypocritical “dear”.\nThe leaf fluttered out of the window. I put my hand over the top\nof the tin.\n“What have you got in the tin, dear? Let Auntie see.”\nI shot it under her nose, hoping it would scare her. I t did. She gave\na regular parrot-screech. The big sister reached across, seized the\ntin, looked, and flung tin, golden toad and all, out of the window.\nThen suddenly those gone hours pulled out and out like taffy. I t\nwas late. The bus wheels started to roll quietly because we were in\ntown now and under Mr. Redfern’s big clock, which gave six slow sad\nstrikes.\nFather pulled out his big silver watch. Uncle pulled out a gold\none. Auntie fussed with a fancy thing all wound up in lace and gold\nchains.\nThey all said “Correct”, snapped the cases shut and put them back\nin their pockets.\nI leaned against Father and shut my eyes.\nThrob-throb-throb—was that Father’s watch eating up minutes or\nwas it hop-hop-hop, my golden toad, making his patient way down\nthe long dusty road, back to the lovely stream where there was no\ntime?"

      "content": "Victoria, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, was the little town;\nI was the little girl.\nIt is hard to remember just when you first became aware of being\nalive. It is like looking through rain onto a bald, new lawn; as you\nwatch, the brown is all pricked with pale green. You did not see the\npoints pierce, did not hear the stab—there they are!\nMy father did not come straight from England to Victoria when,\na lad of nineteen, he started out to see something of the world.\nHe went to many countries, looking, thinking, choosing. At last he\nheard of the California gold rush and went there. He decided that\nCalifornia was a very fine country, but after the rush was over he\nwent back to England, married an English girl and brought his bride\nout to California in a sailing ship, all round Cape Horn. Intending\nto settle in California, he went into business but after a while it\nirked Father to live under any flag other than his own. In a few\nyears, having decided to go back “home” to live, he chartered a\nvessel and took to England the first shipment of California wheat.\nBut, staunch Englishman though my Father was, the New Land had\nsaid something to him and he chafed at the limitations of the Old\nwhich, while he was away from it, had appeared perfect. His spirit\ngrew restless and, selling all his effects, he brought his wife and two\nsmall daughters out to the new world. Round the Horn they came\nagain, and up, up, up the west coast of America till they came to the\nmost English-tasting bit of all Canada—Victoria on the south end of\nVancouver Island, which was then a Crown Colony.\nFather stood still, torn by his loyalty to the Old Land and his\ndelight in the New. He saw that nearly all the people in Victoria were\nEnglish and smiled at how they tried to be more English than the\nEnglish themselves, just to prove to themselves and the world how\nloyal they were being to the Old Land.\nFather set his family down in British Columbia. He and Mother had\naccepted Canada long before I, the youngest but one of their nine\nchildren, was born. By that time their homesickness was healed.\nInstead of being English they had broadened out into being British,\njust as Fort Camosun had swelled herself from being a little\nHudson’s Bay Fort, inside a stockade with bastions at the corners,\ninto being the little town of Victoria, and the capital of British\nColumbia.\nFather bought ten acres of land—part of what was known as\nBeckley Farm. It was over James’ Bay and I have heard my mother\ntell how she cried at the lonesomeness of going to live in a forest.\nYet father’s land was only one mile out of the town. There was but\none other house near—that of Mr. J ames Bissett of the Hudson’s Bay\nCompany. Mr. Bissett had a wife and family. They moved East long\nbefore I was born but I was to know, when nearly grown up, what\nthe love of those pioneer women must have been for one another,\nfor when years later I stood at Mrs. Bissett’s door in Lachine, seeing\nher for the first time, and said, “Mrs. Bissett, I am Emily Carr’s\ndaughter, Emily,” she took me to herself in the most terrific hug.\nAs far back as I can remember Father’s place was all made and\nin order. The house was large and well-built, of California redwood,\nthe garden prim and carefully tended. Everything about it was\nextremely English. It was as though Father had buried a tremendous\nhomesickness in this new soil and it had rooted and sprung up\nEnglish. There were hawthorn hedges, primrose banks, and cow\npastures with shrubberies.\nWe had an orchard and a great tin-lined apple room, wonderful\nstrawberry beds and raspberry and currant bushes, all from\nimported English stock, and an Isabella grape-vine which Father\ntook great pride in. We had chickens and cows and a pig, a grand\nvegetable garden—almost everything we ate grew on our own place.\nJust one of Father’s fields was left Canadian. It was a piece of land\nwhich he bought later when Canada had made Father and Mother\nlove her, and at the end of fifty years we still called that piece of\nground “the new field”. The New Field had a snake fence around it,\nthat is, a zig-zag fence made of split cedar logs or of young sapling\ntrees laid criss-cross, their own weight holding them in place so that\nthey required no nails. Snake fences were extravagant in land and\nin wood, but wood and land were cheaper in Canada in early days\nthan were nails and hinges. You made a gate wherever you wanted\none by lowering bars to pass through and piling them up again. The\nonly English thing in our new field was a stile built across the snake\nfence.\nThe New Field was full of tall fir trees with a few oaks. The\nunderbrush had been cleared away and the ground was carpeted\nwith our wild Canadian lilies, the most delicately lovely of all\nflowers—white with bent necks and brown eyes looking back into\nthe earth. Their long, slender petals, rolled back from their drooping\nfaces, pointed straight up at the sky, like millions of quivering white\nfingers. The leaves of the lilies were very shiny—green, mottled with\nbrown, and their perfume like heaven and earth mixed."

      "title": "James' Bay and Dallas Road",
      "content": "James’ Bay District, where Father’s property lay, was to the south of\nthe town. When people said they were going over James’ Bay they\nmeant that they were going to cross a wooden bridge that straddled\non piles across the James’ Bay mud flats. At high tide the sea flooded\nunder the bridge and covered the flats. It receded again as the tide\nwent out with a lot of kissing and squelching at the mud around the\nbridge supports, and left a fearful smell behind it which annoyed the\nnose but was said to be healthy.\nJames’ Bay was the part of the town to be first settled after\nVictoria had ceased to be a fort. Many Hudson’s Bay men built fine\nhomes across the Bay—Sir James Douglas, Mr. Alexander Munroe,\nMr. J ames Bissett, Mr. J ames Lawson, Senator Macdonald, Bishop\nCridge and Dr. Helmcken.\nThe district began at the south corner of the Bridge where Belville\nStreet crossed it. Belville Street skirted the mud flats until they\nended at Blanshard Street. On the other side of the Bridge, Belville\nran along the harbour’s edge, skipping places where it could not\nget to the water. When it came to the mouth of the harbour it met\nDallas Road and doubled back along the shore of the Straits of Juan\nde Fuca, making a peninsula of the James’ Bay District, the limit of\nwhich was Beacon Hill Park, a beautiful piece of wild land given to\nthe people of Victoria by Sir James Douglas.\nThe Hill itself was grassy, with here and there little thickets of oak\nscrub and clumps of broom. Beyond the Hill the land was heavily\nwooded. When you climbed to the top of Beacon Hill and looked\naround you knew that the school geography was right after all and\nthat the world really was round. Beacon Hill seemed to be the whole\ntop of i t and from all sides the land ran away from you and the edges\nwere lost. To the west lay the purple hills of Sooke; to the south\nwere the Straits of Juan de Fuca, rimmed by the snowy Olympic\nmountains, whose peaks were always playing in and out among the\nclouds till you could not tell which was peak and which sky. On the\neast there were more sea and islands. The town was on the north,\nwith purple Cedar Hill and green Mount Tolmie standing behind it.\nOur winds came from the Olympics in summer and from the icy\nnorth in the winter.\nThere was a good race track measuring exactly one mile, running\nround the base of Beacon Hill. Here they had horse-racing and foot-\nracing. They played cricket and football on the flat ground outside\nthe track, and there were sham battles between sailors and soldiers\nall over the Hill on the Queen’s Birthday. I n the woody swamps of the\nPark millions and millions of frogs croaked all through the Spring\nnights. They sounded as if all the world was made of stiff paper and\nwas crackling up.\nDallas Road was the first pleasure drive made in Victoria.\nEveryone drove along it to admire the view. The road ran sometimes\nclose to the edge of the clay cliffs and sometimes there were\nthickets of willow and wild rose bushes between. The trees and\nbushes were so waved by the beating of the wind that they grew\ncrooked from always being pushed north when they were really\ntrying to poke south into the sun. There were stretches of f ine, soft\ngrass on the cliffs and great patches of camass and buttercups. As\nthe wind swept over these they looked as if they, too, were running\naway from the sea. How the petals of the wild roses managed to\nstick to their middles I can’t think, but they did and the bushes were\nmore pink than green in June. Their perfume, salted by the sea air,\nwas the most wonderful thing that ever happened to your nose.\nBeside one of the willow clumps on the Dallas Road were two\nwhite picket f ences, each just as long as a man. They were the graves\nof t wo sailors who died of smallpox before Victoria had a cemetery.\nThe fences were kept painted but the names on the headboards\nwere faded right out.\nFarther along Dallas Road on the two highest parts of the cliffs\nwere set two cannons, hidden from the Straits by sodded earth\nmounds. These were really ammunition cellars, one on either side of\neach cannon; they had heavy-timbered and padlocked doors which\nwe children longed to see inside. These cannons guarded the\nentrance to Esquimalt Harbour, a British naval base, three miles out\nfrom Victoria.\nMost of the beaches below Dallas Road were pebbly and had\nrough, rocky points jutting out into the sea and dividing the long\nbeaches and the little bays one from another. All the beaches were\npiled with driftwood—great logs bruised and battered out of all\nresemblance to trees except that some of them still had\ntremendous, interlocked roots tough as iron, which defied all the\npounding of the waves, all the battering against the rocks to break\nthem. The waves could only wash them naked and fling them high\nup on the beach to show man what he had to wrestle against under\nthe soil of the Canadian West. But the settlers were not stopped.\nThey went straight ahead taming the land. It took more than roots\nto stop those men.\nThe waters of the Straits were icy. Occasionally we were allowed\nto put on white cotton nightgowns and go bathing in the sea. Your\nbody went down, the nightgown stayed up, icy cold bit through your\nskin. At the first plunge you had no breath left; when it came back it\nwas in screeches that out-screamed the seagulls."

      "title": "Silence and Pioneers",
      "content": "The silence of our Western forests was so profound that our ears\ncould scarcely comprehend it. If you spoke your voice came back to\nyou as your face is thrown back to you in a mirror. I t seemed as if the\nforest were so full of silence that there was no room for sounds. The\nbirds who lived there were birds of prey—eagles, hawks, owls. Had a\nsong bird loosed his throat the others would have pounced. Sober-\ncoloured, silent little birds were the first to follow settlers into the\nWest. Gulls there had always been; they began with the sea and had\nalways cried over it. The vast sky spaces above, hungry for noise,\nsteadily lapped up their cries. The forest was different—she brooded\nover silence and secrecy.\nWhen we were children Father and Mother occasionally drove out\nbeyond the town to Saanich, Metchosin or the Highland District,\nto visit some settler or other carving a home for his family in the\nmidst of overwhelming growth—rebellious, untutored land that\nchallenged his every effort. The settler was raising a family who\nwould carry on from generation to generation. As he and his wife\ntoiled at the breaking and the clearing they thought, “We are taming\nthis wilderness for our children. It will be easier for them than for\nus. They will only have to carry on.”\nThey felled mighty trees with vigour and used blasting powder\nand sweat to dislodge the monster roots. The harder they worked\nwith the land, the more they loved these rooty little brown patches\namong the overwhelming green. The pioneer walked round his new\nfield, pointing with hardened, twisted fingers to this and that which\nhe had accomplished while the woman wrestled with the\ninconveniences of her crude home, planning the smart, modern\nhouse her children would have by and by, but the children would\nnever have that intense joy of creating from nothing which their\nparents had enjoyed; they would never understand the secret\nwrapped in virgin land.\nMr. Scaife, a pioneer, had digged a deep ditch round his forest\nfield. The field was new ploughed. He showed Father with pride how\nfew blackened stumps there were now left in the earth of i t. I let go\nof Father’s hand to gather wild flowers among the pokes of the snake\nfence. I fell into the deep, dry ditch. Brambles and tall grasses closed\nover my head, torn roots in the earthy sides of the ditch scraped\nme as I went down. It was the secret sort of place where snakes like\nto wriggle and where black hornets build their nests—nearly dark,\nonly a little green light f iltering through the brambles over my head.\nI screamed in terror. Willie Scaife, a farm lad, jumped into the ditch\nand pulled me out. He was my first hero.\nThe first Victorians could tell splendid stories of when Victoria\nwas a Hudson’s Bay Post, was called Fort Camosun and had a strong\nblockade about it with a bastion at each corner to protect the\nfamilies of the Hudson’s Bay men from Indians and wild beasts.\nThough my parents did not come to Victoria till after the days\nof the Fort and I was not born for many years after that, still there\nwere people in Victoria only middle-aged when I was little, who had\nlived in the old Fort and could actually tell you about it. Nothing\ndelighted me more than to hear these “still-fresh-yesterday” stories,\nthat were not old “once-upon-a-timers”! You could ask questions of\nthe very story people themselves and they did not have to crinkle\ntheir foreheads, trying to remember a long way back.\nThere was a childless couple with whom I was a favourite—Mrs.\nLewis and her husband, the sea captain. Mrs. Lewis had been Miss\nMary Langford before her marriage. Her father was Captain\nLangford, a naval man. I am not certain whether the Langfords ever\nactually lived in the Fort or not but they came to Victoria at the very\nbeginning of i ts being. Captain Langford built a log farmhouse six or\nseven miles out from town. The district was named for him.\nSometimes when Captain Lewis was away Mrs. Lewis invited me\nto stay with her for company. They lived on Belville Street, on the\nsame side of J ames’ Bay as we did, in a pretty cottage with flowers\nand canaries all over it. The windows overlooked the Harbour and\nMrs. Lewis could watch the Captain’s boat, the old paddle-wheel\nsteamer,Princess Louise, go and come through the Harbour’s\nmouth, and could wave to the Captain on his bridge. It was Captain\nLewis who took me for my first trip by sea, and later, when the\nRailway was built to Nanaimo, for my first trip by rail. When you put\nyour hand in his it was like being led about by a geography (he knew\neverywhere) and Mrs. Lewis was history. Seated at her feet before\nthe fire among the dogs and cats, I listened open-mouthed to tales\nof early Fort days.\nMrs. Lewis was a good teller. She was pretty to watch. The little\nbunch of black curls pinned high at the back of her head bobbed as\nshe talked and her eyes sparkled. She told how young Naval officers\nused to take the pretty Miss Langfords out riding. When they came\nto Goldstream and Millstream, which were bubbling rivers with\nsteep banks, that crossed the Langford trails, the men would\nblindfold the girls’ horses and lead them across the river, using as\na bridge a couple of fallen logs. One night as they were hurrying\nalong a narrow deer trail, trying to get home before dark, they saw a\npanther stretched out on the limb of a tree under which they must\npass in single file. The bushes were too dense for them to turn aside,\nso each rider whipped his horse and made a dash along the trail\nunder the panther.\nMrs. Lewis told, too, of the coming of their piano from England.\nIt sailed all round Cape Horn and was the first piano to come into\nthe Colony of British Columbia. It landed at Esquimalt Harbour and\nwas carried on the backs of Indians in relays of twenty at a time\nthrough a rough bush trail from Esquimalt to Langford. The tired\nIndians put the piano down in a field outside the house to rest a\nminute. The Langford girls rushed out with the key, unlocked and\nplayed the piano out there in the field. The Indians were very much\nastonished. They looked up into the sky and into the woods to see\nwhere the noise came from.\nThe stories jumped sharply out of Mrs. Lewis’s mouth almost\ncatching her breath, as she recalled vividly the excitement which\nthese strange happenings had brought to her and to her sister, just\nout from their sheltered English life.\nSometimes Mrs. Cridge, Mrs. Mouat, Doctor Helmcken, or some\nof Sir James Douglas’s daughters, all of whom had lived in the old\nFort, would start chatting about old days and then we younger\npeople would stand open-mouthed, thinking it must have been\ngrand to live those exciting experiences.\n“It was, my dears,” said Mrs. Cridge, “but remember too that there\nwere lots of things to face, lots of things to do without, lots of\nhardships to go through.”\n. . . .\nI was a very small girl when the business men of Victoria\nchartered a steamer and, accompanied by their families, made a\ntour of Vancouver Island. It took the boat, thePrincess Louise, ten\ndays to go all round the Island. My Father and two of my sisters\nwent. I was thought to be too small but I was not too small to drink\nin every word they said when they came back.\nFather was overwhelmed by the terrific density of growth on the\nIsland. Once when they were tied up for three hours he and another\nman took axes and tried to see how far they could penetrate into\nthe woods in the given time. When the ship’s whistle blew they were\nexhausted and dripping with sweat but their attack on the dense\nundergrowth scarcely showed. Father told of the magnificent trees,\nof their closeness to each other, of the strangling undergrowth,\nthe great silence, the quantity of bald-headed eagles. “Really bald,\nFather?” I asked, but he said they were a rusty black all over except\nfor white heads which shone out against the blue sky and the dark\nforest. Great white owls flew silently among the trees like ghosts,\nand, too, they had seen bears and whales.\nOne of my sisters was more interested in the passengers on the\nboat and made a lot of new friends. The other told me about the\nIndian villages where the boat had touched. This was all far more\ninteresting to me than the stories people had to tell when they came\nback from trips to the Old Country, bragging about the great and\nvenerable sights of the Old Land. I did not care much about old\nthings. These wild, western things excited me tremendously. I did\nnot long to go over to the Old World to see history, I wanted to see\nnow what was out here in our West. I was glad Father and Mother\nhad come as far west as the West went before they stopped and\nsettled down."

      "title": "Saloons and Roadhouses",
      "content": "On almost every street corner in Victoria there was one saloon or\nmore. There were saloons in the middle of every block as well.\nI used to think that every saloon belonged to the Navy because\nsailors, wearing little boys’ collars and wide trouser legs that f lapped\nround their feet, rolled in and out of saloon doors at all times. These\ndoors swung to noiselessly. They were only pinafore doors, made\nof slats and flapped to so quickly when a sailor went in or out that\nyou never got a chance to see what i t was they hid, not even if you\nwere right in front when one was pushed open and nearly knocked\nyou over. We were strictly forbidden to look at a saloon in passing.\nGrown-ups dragged you quickly past and told you to look up the\nstreet though there was nothing whatever to see there.\nThis made me long to know what was inside saloons. What was it\nmat we were not supposed to see? Why was it naughty to twist your\nneck and look? You heard laughing and singing behind the swing\ndoors. What did they do in there?\nThere were saloons, too, every few miles along the driving roads.\nThese they called road-houses. Each had two doors. Over one was\nwritten “Parlour”, over the other, “Bar”. These road-houses were\nmost attractive; they had verandahs with beautiful flower-boxes\nat the windows, filled with gay flowers and drooping, five-finger\nmaidenhair fern. Very often they had cages of birds and of wild\nanimals too. The Colonist Hotel in Beacon Hill Park had a panther on\nits verandah. The Four Mile House had a cage of raccoons. Another\nroad-house had a baby bear and another a cage of owls.\nOnce when Aunt and Uncle were visiting us from San Francisco\nwe took a long drive on a hot day. When we got to the top of the\nFour Mile Hill Uncle poked Father. Father ignored the poke and we\npassed the bar and drove to the bottom of the hill. Then Father dug\nthe driver in the back and he pulled up his horses. Father, Uncle and\nthe driver all toiled up the hill again on foot, leaving us sitting in\nthe hack by the roadside. We children were allowed to get out and\ngather wild roses. I slipped behind the hack and started up the hill to\nhave a look at the coons in the cage. Mother called me back. Auntie\nsaid something about “the unwholesome nosiness of little people”.\nI said, “I just wanted to see the little coons, Auntie.”\n“Pick some roses for Auntie,” she ordered, but when I did she\nthrew them over the wheel. She said the dust on them made her\nsneeze.\nGoodacre, the butcher, had a slaughter-house out on Cadboro\nBay Road. Cattle and sheep were brought from the Mainland by\nboat and landed at the wharf in front of Father’s store. They were\nthen driven straight through the centre of the town, up Fort Street\nwhich, after it had gone straight in the town, wiggled and twisted\nand called itself “Cadboro Bay Road”.\nThe wild range cattle were crazed with fright. They bellowed and\nplunged all over the sidewalk, hoofing up the yellow dust. Women\nran to shut their gates before the cattle rushed in and trampled their\ngardens. All the way up the street doors banged and gates slammed\nas everyone hurried to shelter.\nI had been to visit my sister who lived on Fort Street. I was to\ngo home by myself as there was no one to fetch me that day. I t\nwas the first time I had been through town alone. When I was just\nopposite the Bee Hive Saloon a drove of these wild cattle came\ntearing up the street. They were almost on top of me before I knew\nwhat all the dust and shouting and bellowing was about. Men with\nlong whips whooped, dogs barked, the street seemed to be waving\nup and down with the dull red movement of beasts’ backs bumping\nthrough the dust. Suddenly I was snatched up in a pair of huge black\narms, a black face was near mine. It had grinning white teeth. We\nbacked through the swing door and I was inside a saloon at last.\nThe big black man set me down on the bar. The barkeeper and the\nnegro ran to the window to look over the painted green glass at the\nboiling tumult of cattle outside. I could only hear their bellowing and\nscuttling.\nI looked around the Saloon. Shiny taps were beside me and behind\nthe long counter-bar ran shelves full of bottles and sparkling\nglasses; behind them again was looking-glass so that there seemed\nto be twice as many bottles and twice as many glasses as there really\nwere, and two barmen and two negroes and two me’s! In the back\nhalf of the saloon were barrels and small wooden tables; chairs with\nround backs stood about the floor with their legs sunk in sawdust;\nbright brass spitoons were everywhere. The saloon was full of the\nsmell of beer and of sawdust. There was nothing else, nothing that I\ncould see to make anyone sing.\nThe noise moved on up the street. The two men returned to the\nbar. The barman poured something yellow into a glass and shoved\nit towards the negro who threw back his head and gulped it like\nmedicine. Then he lifted me down, held the swing door open and I\nwent out into the still unsettled, choking dust of Fort Street.\nMy big sister had a kind heart. Nothing pleased her more than to\ndrive old, lame or tired people into the country. There was always\nsome ailing person tucked up in her little phaeton being aired. All\nabout Victoria were lovely drives—Admiral Road, Burnside, Cadboro\nBay, Cedar Hill. The country roads were very dusty and dry, so every\nfew miles there was a road-house with a bar for men and a watering\ntrough for horses—ladies went thirsty. No lady could possibly be\nseen going into a bar even if only for a glass of water.\nWe bought a new horse called Benny. His former master had been\naccustomed to look in at every road-house bar. Benny knew them\nevery one. If my sister were talking to her invalid passenger and not\nnoticing, Benny swerved gently up to the bar door and stopped so\ndead it unsettled the ladies’ bonnets.\nWhen my sister saw where she was she would give Benny a cut\nwith the whip which would send him dashing from the saloon door\nat a guilty gallop, my sister sitting very red and crooked behind him.\nShe was sure just then to meet someone whom she knew and be too\nupset to bow and then she had double shame."

      "title": "Ways of Getting Round",
      "content": "Beyond the few blocks of Victoria upon which the shops stood\nthe roads were of dirt and had sidewalks of one, two or three\nplanks according to the street’s importance. A great many people\nkept cows to supply their own families with milk. When their own\npasture field was eaten down they turned the cow into the street to\nbrowse on roadside grass along the edges of the open ditches, or to\nmeander out to the grassy land on top of the cliffs off Dallas Road.\nVictoria cows preferred to walk on the plank sidewalks in winter\nrather than dirty their hooves in the mud by the roadside. They liked\nto tune their chews to the tap, tap, tap of their feet on the planks.\nLadies challenged the right of way by opening and shutting their\numbrellas in the cows’ faces and shooing, but the cows only chewed\nharder and stood still. It was the woman-lady, not the lady-cow who\nhad to take to the mud and get scratched by the wild rose bushes\nthat grew between sidewalk and fence while she excursioned round\nthe cow.\nIf people did not wish their flowers to be turned into milk it\nwas up to them to fence their gardens. Father’s property was very\nsecurely fenced and his cows were always kept within their own\npastures. We had a painted fence in front of our property, tarred\nfences on the sides, and our field had a snake fence.\nThere was no way to get about young Victoria except on\nlegs—either your own or a horse’s. Those people who had a field, a\nbarn, and a cow usually kept a horse too. The horses did not roam;\nthey had to be kept handy for hitching. All the vehicles used were\nvery English. Families with young children preferred a chaise, in\nwhich two people faced the horse and two the driver. These chaises\nwere low and so heavy that the horse dragged, despondent and\nslow. The iron tires made such a rumbling over the rough stony\nroads that i t was difficult to hear conversation while travelling in a\nchaise especially when to the rumble was added the rattle of wheel\nspokes that had got over-dry and loosened. What you did then was\nto drive as deep as you dared into the first stream you knew of and\nlet the chaise wheels soak, all the while encouraging the horse to go\nforward and back, turning the wheels in the water until they swelled\nagain. You could not go into very deep water for fear of drowning\nthe driver for the chaises were set so low that the driver sat right\ndown among the wheel hubs. If children fell out of these low chaises\nthey did not get hurt, only dusty. The horse stood so much higher\nthan the driver that there was a tall iron rack in the front to hold the\nreins so that the horse could not swish his tail over them and pin the\nreins down so tight that he could not be guided.\nMen preferred to drive in high, two-wheeled dog-carts in which\npassengers sat back to back and bumped each other’s shoulder\nblades. The seat of the driver was two cushions higher than that of\nthe other passengers. Men felt frightfully high and fine, perched up\nthere, cracking the whip over the horse’s back and looking over the\ntops of their wives’ hats. There were American buggies, too, with or\nwithout hoods which could be folded back like the top of a baby’s\npram.\nInVictorianobodywasinaparticularhurrytoget\nanywhere—driving was done mostly for the pleasure of fresh air and\nscenery.\nIn town there were lots of livery stables where you could hire\nhorses or could board your own. The smell of horse manure was so\nmuch a part of every street that i t sat on your nose as comfortably\nas a pair of spectacles. Of course there were no livery stables among\nthe drygoods, food, and chemists’ shops. Everywhere else you saw\n“Livery Stable” printed above wide, cool entries and heard horses\nchewing and stamping, and saw long rows of tails swishing out\nof stalls on either side of a plank-way while ugly, square vehicles\ncalled hacks stood handy waiting for horses to be hitched to them.\nThese hacks for hire were very stuffy. The town had one imported\nhansom-cab which drought itself very smart, and there was Mr.\nWinter’s picnic carriage, a huge vehicle that held as many children\nas the Old Woman’s Shoe. When i ts wide, circular back seat was\ncrammed and more children were heaped on top of Mr. Winter\nup on his high driver’s seat, and they were all yelling, and yellow\ndust rolling, and wheels rumbling, it looked and sounded like a\nbeehive swarming. For immense affairs like Sunday School picnics\nand excursions there were yellow buses with long rows of windows,\nlong, wooden seats, uncushioned except for strips of carpet running\nfrom driver to door. They had no springs to speak of, and were so\nnoisy that you could not hear your own groans being bumped out of\nyou.\nVictoria’s baker and butcher boys delivered meat and bread on\nhorse-back, carrying their loaves and joints in huge wicker baskets\nrested against their hips. As soon as they had one foot in the stirrup\nand while their other leg was still flying in the air over the horse as\nhe galloped off, they shouted “Giddap!” It was a wonder the boys did\nnot grow crooked balancing such heavy baskets on their hips, but\nthey did not,—they were straight and strong. I used to wish I were a\ndelivery boy to throw my leg across a horse and shout “Giddap!” to\nfeel myself rush through the air, but I should have preferred bread\nto meat in my basket.\nThe first time I knew that Victoria was slower than other towns\nwas when, at the age of t welve, I was recovering from typhoid fever\nand a lady whom Mother knew, and whose two children had had\ntyphoid in the same epidemic as I, took me along with her little girls\nfor a trip to Puget Sound. It was my first visit to an American city\nand I felt giddy in the head from its rush. I heard Americans laugh\nand say “slow as a Canadian” and call my town “sleepy old Victoria”.\nI heard one man say to another, “Went across the line this\nsummer.”\n“Did eh? What sort of a place is Victoria?”\n“Sleepiest ever!” laughed the first, “Every place of business had a\nnotice up, ‘Gone to lunch. Back in a couple of hours.’”\nThat was the first time I knew we were slow.\nSan Francisco was the biggest, the most important city on the\nPacific Coast. It was a terrible trip in the small, bouncy steamer,\ndown the rough coast. Victorians only went for something very,\nvery important like a big operation or a complete change for health,\nto save their lives. Even then they stuck their noses up and said,\n“I am going across the line,” or “going to the other side”, as if the\n“other side” was an underneath and inferior side of the earth. But,\nif they had to have such an enormous operation that it was quite\nbeyond Victoria’s skill, then, rather than go all round the Horn back\nto England and either die before they got there or else get well and\nforget what the operation was for, they allowed San Francisco to\n“operate” them.\nAmericans dashed across the line sometimes to look at us\nCanadians and at British Columbia as if we had been dust-covered\nantiques. They thought English and Canadian people as slow and\nstupid as we thought the American people uncomfortable\nrushers—makers of jerry-built goods that fell to pieces in no time.\nWe preferred to wait ages for our things to come by sailing ship\nround the Horn from England rather than to buy American goods.\nThis annoyed the American manufacturers.\nAn aunt of ours in San Francisco sent us American dolls. They\nwere much prettier than English dolls. The first that came were\nmade of wax but they melted when we left them in the sun. Next\nChristmas she sent us bisque dolls, very lovely but too breakable to\nhug; we could not even kiss them but they cracked. We went back\nto our lovable old wood and china dolls that took their time to come\nto us all round the Horn, and, even if they were plain, they were\nsubstantial and could bear all the loving we gave them."

      "content": "Victoria was like a lying-down cow, chewing. She had made one\nenormous effort of upheaval. She had hoisted herself from a\nHudson’s Bay Fort into a little town and there she paused, chewing\nthe cud of imported fodder, afraid to crop the pastures of the new\nworld for fear she might lose the good flavour of the old to which\nshe was so deeply loyal. Her jaws went rolling on and on, long after\nthere was nothing left to chew.\nGovernment Street was the main street of the town. Fort Street\ncrossed it and at the cross, in a little clump, stood most of the shops.\nOn Yates, View and Broad Streets were a few lesser shops, several\nlivery stables and a great many saloons. On Bastion Street stood the\nCourthouse and the Jail. Down on Wharf Street, facing the Harbour,\nwere the wholesale houses. Fisgard, Cormorant and Johnson Streets\nwere Chinatown. At the tail ends of all these streets were dwelling\nhouses set in gardens where people grew their own flowers and\nvegetables.\nThe rest of Victoria was higgledy-piggledy. I t was the cows who\nlaid out the town, at least that portion of i t l ying beyond the few\nmain streets. Cow hooves hardened the mud into twisty lanes in\ntheir meanderings to and fro—people just followed in the cows’\nfootsteps.\nWhen the first settlers cut up their acreage, the resulting lots\nwere all shapes and sizes. Owners made streets and lanes over the\nproperty anywhere that seemed convenient at the moment.\nMy father was a wholesale importer of provisions, wines and\ncigars. His store was down on Wharf Street among other wholesale\nplaces. The part of Wharf Street where Father’s store stood had only\none side. In front of the store was a great hole where the bank of\nthe shoreline had been dug out to build wharves and sheds. You\ncould look over the top of these to the Songhees Indian Reserve\non the opposite side of the Harbour. To one side of the hole stood\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company’s store—a long, low building of r ed brick\nwith a verandah. The Indians came across the Harbour in their\ndugout canoes to trade at the store. They squatted on the verandah,\ndiscussing new-bought goods, or their bare feet pattered up and\ndown the board walks of Wharf Street. They were dressed in gay\nprint dresses, plaid shawls and bright head handkerchiefs. Once I\nsaw Father’s man take out case after case of beautiful cluster Malaga\nraisins and pour them into the outspread shawls and handkerchiefs\nof the jabbering Indians, who held out their hands and stuffed their\nmouths, giving grunts of delight.\nI asked Father, “Why do you give all these raisins to the Indians?”\nHe replied, “They are maggoty, the whole lot of them—but Indians\nlove raisins and don’t mind maggots at all.”\nAt the opposite side of the Wharf Street hole stood the Customs\nHouse, close to the water’s edge. Made of red brick, it was three\nstoreys high and quite square. The Customs House steps were very\ndignified,—high and wide-spread at the bottom. Underneath the\nsteps was the Gregorys’ door.\nGregory was an Old Country gardener. His wife was very\nhomesick as well as really ill. The Gregorys were the caretakers of\nthe Customs House. In front of their rooms they had a beautiful\nlittle garden, sheltered by a brick wall. Sometimes Mother sent\nMrs. Gregory things and Mrs. Gregory gave us beautiful posies of\nflowers in exchange. On the lower floor of the Customs House,\nwhere the Gregorys had their quarters, there was a wide hall which\nran straight through the building. The wind roared down this\npassage from a great doorway opening onto the Harbour. Furious\nthat the Gregorys’ door under the steps was not big enough to let\nit all out at once, it pounded and bellowed at all the doors down\nthe hall as it passed them. The waves came dashing up the slip and\nrushed through the door and into the hall. I used to think that ships\nsailed right into the Gregorys’ hall-way to do their customs business\nand I begged to go to see Mrs. Gregory on any excuse whatever,\nalways hoping to meet a ship sailing down the hall-way. I was much\ndisappointed that I never struck a tide high enough to bring a ship\nin. Once I thought I was going to but when no more than two waves\nhad washed in through the great doors Mr. Gregory rushed out, shut\nand barred them.\nThe inside of Father’s store was deep and dark. Cases, crates, and\nbarrels stood piled one on top of another right up to the ceiling,\nwith just a narrow lane running down the middle and ending in what\nwas called “the yard”—not a yard at all, only a strong, rough board\nshed filled with “empties” and cats. There were no windows; the\ncats crawled in and out of the “empties” hunting for rats, their eyes\nshining in the black. Slits of daylight cut between the boards of the\nshed walls, and shadows thrown by a sputtering gas jet made it all\nspooky and unreal—different from the solid, comfortable feel of the\nouter store, crammed with provisions.\nFather had every colour of cat. He took fresh milk in a bottle from\nhome every morning to them; he said a diet of straight rat was not\nhealthy for cats. Only one of them was a comfortable, particular cat\nand came to sit by the stove in Father’s office. The rest were just\nwholesale cats.\nFather’s office was beside the open front of his big store and in it\nFather sat in front of a large, square table covered with green baize;\non it in front of him was a cupboard full of drawers and pigeon-\nholes. He sat in a high-backed wicker armchair. His beard was white\nand, after he went bald, he wore a black skull cap. A fat round stove,\nnearly always red hot, was between Father’s table and the long, high\ndesk where his men stood or sat on high stools doing their books\nwhen they were not trundling boxes on a truck. There was an iron\nsafe in one corner of the office with a letter press on top and there\nwere two yellow chairs for customers to sit on while Father wrote\ntheir orders in his book. Everything was dozened in Father’s store:\nhis was not a business that sold things by pinches in paper bags.\nHigh along the wall ran four long shelves holding glass jars of sample\nEnglish sweets—all pure, all wholesome, all English. The labels said\nso."

      "content": "As I first remember it, James’ Bay district had many fields and plenty\nof wooded land left, but houses began to creep nearer and nearer\nto ours and the fields were being cut up into town lots. I was very\nsorry when Bishop Cridge’s big, wild field opposite us was sold. The\nBishop’s house sat back in a little bit of wood with an orchard and\ntwo fields. His driveway curved and had laurels and little bushes of\nyellow roses all the way up. We children used to play “ladies” in the\nBishop’s wild field with his three little girls. Being the youngest of\nthe six children I could never be a “lady”—I had always to be “bad\nchild”, while the play mothers fed me on green gooseberries, wild\nand very sour.\nThe Bishop’s house was built some time after Father’s. The street\nwas very narrow and in that one long block from Toronto to Simcoe\nStreet there was only his house and ours. Father gave a good strip of\nhis land to make the street wider; so the City named it Carr Street\nafter Father. Carr Street would have joined Birdcage Walk if Mrs.\nMcConnell’s cow farm had not stood in the way, and Birdcage Walk\nwould have been Government Street if the James’ Bay Bridge had\nnot been there to get people over the mud flats. After many years\nGovernment Street swallowed them all—James’ Bay Bridge, Carr\nStreet and Birdcage Walk—and went straight out to Dallas Road.\nOne day when we were playing “ladies” in the Bishop’s field and\nI, the “baby”, was being hidden in the bushes from the ferocious\nwild beast which ate children but which was really the Bishop’s\ngentle cow “Colie”, some men climbed over the fence. They had\ninstruments on three legs which they set beside the road and\nsquinted through. They came right into our mock-orange parlour\nand our gooseberry-bush dining-room. They swept the tin cans\nwhich had furnished our kitchen from our own particular log and\nsat down upon it and wrote in little books. They even tore pickets off\nthe fence. The cow was taken to another enclosure, wagons dumped\nlumber and bricks all over the field. Soon real houses stood on top of\nour pretend ones, real ladies smacked real babies and pushed prams\nright on top of where our fun had been, and Mother was sending us\nacross to ask if the new neighbour would like pots of tea or anything\ntill her own stove was up."

      "title": "Visiting Matrons",
      "content": "Victoria matrons did not fritter away their time in the paying of\nshort calls. They had large families. The Chinese help could not be\nleft in charge of the nursery while the mothers went visiting. So\nwhen they came to call, they brought their family along and stayed.\nBesides, unless people had a horse, there was no way of getting\nabout other than on foot. So ladies took their families of young\nchildren along, packing the baby into the pram, wedging him in\nfirmly with feeding bottles, infant necessities, a bag of needlework\nand the mother’s little lace cap in a paper bag. After an early lunch\nthey started immediately, prepared to make a day of i t. The visit had\nbeen planned between the two ladies a long time ahead, weather\npermitting.\nAverage ladies had six children. When a family visited us the\neldest wheeled the youngest in the pram. They all trooped through\nour gate. First the baby was exhibited, fed and put to sleep. Then\nthe visitor took off her bonnet and put on her cap. The children\ndispersed to see dolls, pets and eat enormous quantities of fruit\npicked right off the trees. Our visitors were always very anxious\nabout their families when they heard of all the plums, apples,\ncherries and pears they had eaten while the ladies sat sewing in the\ngarden. Mother told them not to worry and none of them ever died\nof i t. Mother knew a certain number of families whom she invited to\nour garden for one long summer afternoon every year.\nMy big sister used to visit a friend who had three little girls the\nsame ages as we three. We played with them while the ladies visited\nin the drawing-room.\nThose children had all the things we did not, and we had what\nthey did not. They lived on the waters of the Arm and had a boat.\nThey had a pony and a big kennel of hunting dogs. Their Mama was\nstern and their Papa easy;ourFather was stern, our Mother easy.\nOur garden was prim and theirs rambling.\nThose friends were as far from town on the other side as we were\nfrom town on our side. There were two bridges to cross and ever\nso many different kinds of smells to pass through. From our own\ngate to the James’ Bay Bridge wild rose bushes grew at the roadsides\nnearly all the way and their perfume was delicious. Then we came to\nthe mud flats and our noses hurt with its dreadfulness when the tide\nwas out. We had no sooner got over that than there was Chinatown\nwith stuffy, foreign smells. Then came the gas-works—this smell\nwas said to be healthful but it was not nice. Rock Bay Bridge had\nmore low-tide smells, which were made easier by a saw-mill; the\nnew sawdust smelled so nice that you forgot your nose until the\nother end of the bridge came. There sat a tannery from which came,\nI thought, the worst smell of them all. There was one still more\ndreadful—Parker’s slaughter-house and piggery—but that was two\nmiles further on and we did not have to pass it on me way to call on\nour friends.\nSometimes our friends rowed us down to James’ Bay Bridge in\ntheir boat and we slipped past all the smells and were home in no\ntime.\nIn early Victoria there were family evening parties to which the\nfather, mother and all sizes of growing children went together and\nat which they played charades, dumb crambo, guessing games and\nforfeits. There was music, too, for nearly everyone could play at\nleast one piece on the piano or sing a song or do a recitation, or\nthey did things together. Nobody minded if it was not quite perfect.\nEveryone laughed just the same. Everyone helped to entertain the\nothers and you did some trick or told a story if you could not sing.\nMy two big sisters went to Navy balls occasionally, but Father did\nnot approve of the way Victoria mothers scrambled among the Navy\nto find husbands for their daughters. He was very strict: he had\nmade a nice home for us and thought we should stay in it.\nAnother form of young Victoria entertainment was the church\nconversazione. The Bishop opened, shut and blessed the affair but\nthe congregation did the talking. Conversaziones were held in the\nchurch school-room which the ladies cut into little cubicles with\nbenches—three sitting sides and one open. The benches were just\nclose enough for one lady’s lips to reach across confidentially to the\nopposite lady’s ear. There was music for people who were not chatty\nand when everything had been done and encored tea was served.\nYoung girls carried it to the cubicles. Both sexes and all ages came\nto conversaziones. You had to pay only two bits, which was twenty-\nfive cents, for all the talking, listening, music, tea and the Bishop’s\nblessing.\nPresbyterians had what were called church socials but, as they\nwere held in the church itself, personal conversation was very\nrestricted. Dr. Reid told stories from the pulpit, there was choir\nsinging and no tea.\nAs Victoria grew bigger, social groups grew smaller, selecting only\nthose people who were congenial to each other. They became too\na great deal more particular about the ability of performers and the\nquality of entertainment. Victoria stood like a gawky girl, waiting,\nwaiting to be a grown-up city."

      "title": "Servants",
      "content": "What with big families and only green little Chinese boys for\nservants, Victoria matrons were kept busy. The boys came from\nChina at the age of twelve. It took much patience to teach these\nforeign children our language as well as how to work.\nEnglish servants who came out to Canada did so with the firm\ndetermination of f inding a husband in a hurry and of making homes\nand raising families who would be not servants but masters. While\nwaiting for the husbands these women accepted positions,\ngrumbling from morning till night at the inconveniences of the\nWest. There were hosts of bachelors trying to make good in this new\nworld—men who were only too willing to marry a helpmate. Love\ndid not much matter if she was competent and these women in their\nturn were glad enough to go through drudgery and hardship if they\nwere working for themselves and for their own independence. Man\nand wife each got something from the bargain and pushed forward,\nkeeping step choppily, getting used to each other’s gait. While these\nimported-from-England domestics were creating a class to put\nthemselves into, Victoria ladies made do with raw, neat pigtailed,\nhomesick China boys. Many a muddly housewife, accustomed to\ngood servants in the Old Country, had first herself to learn how to\nrun a house before she could teach her Chinese help.\nThe Chinese all wore clothes cut from exactly the same\npattern—long black pants, loose white shirts worn outside the\npants, white socks and aprons, cloth shoes with soles an inch thick\nand no heels. They scuffled along with a little dragging slip-slop\nsound.\nThe Chinese kept themselves entirely to themselves like rain\ndrops rolling down new paint—learning our ways, keeping their\nown. When their work was done they put on black cloth coats made\nthe same shape as their white shirts, let the pigtail which had been\nwound round their heads all day flop down their backs, and off they\nwent to Chinatown to be completely Chinese till the next morning.\nThey learned just enough of our Canadian ways to earn Canadian\nmoney—no more.\nOur Chinaboy, Bong, was not pretty—he was pock-marked; but\nBong was a good boy and was part of our childhood. He came to\nMother at the age of t welve, green and homesick, without one word\nof English. When things were more than Bong could bear he sat\ndown and cried. Then Mother patted his shoulder as if he had been\none of her own children and said, “Come on, Bong, be a good boy,”\nand Bong would rub his big sleeve across his eyes, run out to the\nbarn and sing a little Chinese song to the cow. The cow was a great\ncomfort to Bong. She would stop chewing, roll back her ears and\nlisten to the Chinese words as if she understood them. Bong loved\nher.\nBong stayed with us for many years. We were all as fond of him\nas one could be of anything holding itself so completely aloof. He\nseemed really to love my little brother. When Bong went back to\nChina to see his mother, he left a hole in our kitchen and a hole in\nthe cow-yard, queer, f oreign holes, belonging and not belonging to\nus, for Bong never had become one bit Canadian in all the years he\nworked for us in Canada.\nThere was Wash Mary too, an Indian woman who came to wash\nfor Mother every Monday. She was gentle, had a crinkled-up skin\nand was so small she had to stand on a block to reach her washtub.\nThe Indian in Mary was more human and understandable than the\nChinese in Bong.\nThe wash-house was across the yard. First Mary lit the stove; then\nshe hung her shawl up on a nail and there was her thin, lumpy little\nbody, buttoned into a pink print dress with a very full skirt reaching\nright to her bare feet. But her clothes were western, not eastern like\nBong’s. She took off the black silk handkerchief that bound her head.\nHer hair, thick and black, stood up from both sides of the parting\nthat began at her forehead and ended at the back of her neck. On\neach side the hair was roped into a thick plait. The right plait had\nnothing to do with the left till after it had reached and rested on\nher shoulder blades; then the plaits were united again, tied together\nwith a bit of string and looped across Mary’s shoulders like a strong,\nsplendid handle.\nMary was a wonderful washer. The suds boiled up to her\nshoulders and the steam about her faded the wrinkles till she looked\nalmost young. Up and down, up and down, she went over her\nwashboard, her brown eyes staring and her mouth tied up in\npuckers. It was a big mouth that could hold six clothes pins at once.\nAfter our lines were full of washing and Mother’s clothes white as\nsnow, and after Mary had enjoyed a good dinner in our kitchen,\nshe shut herself into the wash-house and washed and dried all\nthe clothes she wore, drying them quickly over the fire. Then she\nknotted her dollar into the corner of her new-washed handkerchief\nand went smiling out of the gate.\nMary was not a Songhees Indian. She lived in a little house in\nFairfield."

It was the\nChinese man but the Indian woman who shouldered the burden.\nThe Chinaman’s wife was back home in China. The Indian rolled\nleisurely and with empty hands, behind his squaw. A cedar-root\nburden basket of her own weaving was slung across the woman’s\nback, steadied by a woven pack strap worn across the chest. Women\nof some tribes wore the strap across their foreheads, pushing their\nheads forward against the burden’s weight.\nThe Indian squatted upon each doorstep to rest. The Chinaman\nnever rested—he kept up his mechanical jog-trot all day. He lived\nfrugally, sending the earnings of his brown, calloused hands and\nhis sweating toil home to China. The Indian wasted no sweat on\nlabour—he took from nature those things which came easiest. What\nmoney he earned he spent in the nearest store immediately,\nexchanging it for whatever pleased his eye or his stomach. The\nIndian’s money circulated; he had no idea of i ts value nor of saving\nit. The satisfying of immediate needs was enough for him. To our\nsombre landscape his careless picturesqueness was an enrichment.\nHe was the link between the primitive and civilization. Unlike the\nChinese vegetable gardener who forced the land to produce so that\nhe might make money from it, money to send back to China, taking\nthe land’s goodness, not caring to put anything back, the native\nIndian sat staring, enjoying leaving Nature to do her own work\nwhile he got along with a minimum of exertion and a great deal of\nhappiness.\nThe white man more or less understood the childlike Indian; he\nbelonged to his own hemisphere.

Indians were allowed to pitch a tent and remain the\nnight on any beach during their long canoe journeys up and down\nthe Coast.\nThis party of Indians was coming to Victoria but there was no\nhurry, the waves were high and night came down. The canoe\ncontained the family and all they owned. There was a man, a woman,\nthree children, one dog, two cats, a crate of f owls, besides a tent,\nbedding, cooking utensils, fishing gear, clothes and odd bits of\nhoarded possessions gleaned from Nature’s bounty or from man’s\ndiscards.\nThey flung an old tent across a conveniently low willow bough\nthat stuck out of the bank. The unpegged sides of the tent flapped\nand billowed in the wind, rain drizzled. They tossed the bedding\nunder the tent. The man, dog and cats crept at once into its\ncosiness.\nThe woman and children huddled round a low beach fire, tending\nthe black iron cooking-pot and the tall tin for the brewing of tea. A\nsleeping child was tucked among the shapeless folds of the woman’s\nmotherliness, under her shawl. The movement of her arms across\nhis sleeping body did not disturb him when she mended the fire.\nShe was tired with his heaviness and from the sweep of her paddle\nall day long. She yawned, lolled back against a log and swept the\nbay with eyes used to judging what wind and waves were up to.\nSuddenly she called to her man; a lazy hand raised the canvas. The\nman followed with screwed-up eyes the woman’s pointing finger.\nOut in the bay a lone Chinaman in a clumsy fish-boat was\nwrestling with his sail. The unwieldy craft lay over first to one side,\nthen to the other, her sail almost flat to the water. That the man in\nher did not tip out was a marvel.\nThe Indian man and woman left their fire and their supper.\nWaddling across the pebbles, they launched the heavy canoe. The\nwoman laid her baby in the bow, close under the canoe’s wolf-\nhead prow, while she did a full share of the shoving and grunting\nnecessary to launch the craft. It was she who stepped into the icy\nwater to give the final freeing push, then she got into the canoe\nwhich was already staggering among the waves. She took her\nsteering paddle and directed the canoe how to cut each wave. The\nman doggedly dipped, dipped, dipped his paddle, giving force, but\nnot guidance.\nThey helped the Chinaman to ship his sail and clamber into their\ncanoe. They brought him ashore, towing his boat behind them.\nThe Chinaman’s face was a greenish mask; nervous grins of\ngratitude were strewn over it. He sat himself uncomfortably on a\nlog near the Indians’ fire. They squatted round their fish pot, dog\nand cats skulked near, hoping. The man dipped, the woman and the\nchildren dipped. The Chinaman dipped but, too embarrassed, ate\nsparingly. No words were spoken. The only sound was that of clams\nbeing sucked from their shell and the brittle rap of the empties flung\namong the stones.\nThe woman poured tea into a tin cup and passed it to the\nChinaman. The sham grin left the man’s face, his Oriental mask\ndropped. Bowing to the woman, he raised the steaming liquid to his\nlips, made a kissing sound into the tea and sluiced its warmth noisily\ninto every corner of his mouth before the great gulps gurgled down\nhis throat. The woman nodded.\n“Uh-huh!” she said, and smiled."

The Hill\nsloped gently to the town on its north side and sharply down to\nJames’ Bay on the south, with shelves and sheer drops where rock\nhad been blasted out for roadmaking.\nA French family by the name of J ourand built Roccabella, a large\nboarding-house on the south side of Church Hill just below the\nCathedral. It had a beautiful garden and was a quietly superior place\nin which to stay, holding its own even after modern conveniences in\nother boarding-houses overtook its level, clinging to its little open\nfireplaces and defying central heating. English guests particularly\nfavoured Roccabella. They liked the sound of the Cathedral bells\nthat came quavering in through their windows. They liked to sit by\ntheir own particular fire and to look across James’ Bay to the snowy\nOlympics.\nThe first Cathedral was burned down. The one I remember was\nbuilt of wood and had a square tower with a cross on top. As Victoria\ngrew they kept adding wings and more wings to the Cathedral till it\nlooked squat and mother-hennish. Brick and stone churches sprang\nup in other parts of the city but the national significance of the\nold wooden Cathedral, sitting on the top of its hill, made it, in\ncomparison with the others, like the star on top of a Christmas tree.\nThe tree’s other ornaments seemed mere baubles. Christ Church\nCathedral was the emblem of our National Faith. It meant something\nto every Briton, whether he realized it or not, whether he were\nMethodist, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, no matter what he\nworshipped, even if he professed no religion at all. There was\nsomething particularly British, something secure about it.\nOur family did not attend Christ Church Cathedral. Mother went\nto the Reformed Episcopal Church on Humboldt Street. Church Hill\nwas too steep for her to climb and anyway she liked the evangelical\nservice.\nBishop Cridge of the Reformed Episcopal Church had once been\nDean of the Cathedral, but, long before I can remember, he and\nBishop Hills had had a bitter clash of conscience—“High” and “Low”,\nthat same old controversy that never will be settled while people are\npeople. Spiteful folks spoke of this church split as “the Big Church\nkicking the Little Church down the hill.” The little church smiled\nup from the mud flats, the Cathedral frowned down, austere and\nnational, and Victorians chose High or Low, whichever comforted\nthem most."

It\nwas only one-half block big and was already nearly full when we\nwent through it coming from church one Sunday morning. It had\na picket f ence and was surrounded by tall, pale trees whose leaves\nhad silver backs. Except for what care relatives gave the graves, it\nwas a wild place, grave being tied to grave by a network of brambles\nand vines. There were one or two handsome headstones among the\nmat of wild and tame, flowers and weeds—interwoven growth. It\nwas a favourite nesting place for the few shy birds that were native\nto British Columbia.\nOn the far side of the cemetery the Chinese had erected a great\nstone altar on which they placed whole pigs roasted and great piles\nof white cakes, looking like pure grease, to please the appetites of\ntheir dead who lay in rows in front of unpainted headboards with\nonly Chinese characters written on them. The graves were as much\nalike as the Chinese themselves had been in clothes, pigtails and\ncustoms in life. There those foreigners lay, temporarily pitted, like\nwinter vegetables. When there were bones enough they would all be\ngathered together from the graves and shipped back to China.\nWhen the old Quadra Cemetery was quite full, its gates were\nclosed and it was left to go entirely wild. Only the very tallest\nmonuments could peer above the bushes. They seemed to say,\n“Hush!” as we children clattered past on our way to school.\nVictoria had made a big new cemetery at Ross Bay, much farther\nout of town. Funerals took far longer then. The horses were not\nallowed to go faster than a walk as long as the corpse was behind\nthem. They might trot as briskly as they liked back to town with\nthe empty hearse behind them. Hayward’s hearse had six enormous\nblack plumes waving over the top of i t. They swayed and writhed\nand were considered most dignified and in very good taste. Mr.\nStorey, the rival undertaker, had a hearse with six fuzzy black things\non top having waists like the forms dressmakers use for fitting; they\nhad woolly tails hanging down all round, waggling and lashing as\nthe hearse went over the bumpy roads. They looked like six angry\nmonkeys dancing over the coffin. Crêpe streamed from the hats\nof the undertaker, the driver, the widows’ bonnets, the carriage\nwhips and the knobs of the house doors where death waited for the\nhearse. The horses that dragged the dead were black and wore black\nplumes nodding on the top of their heads, black nets over their\nbacks with drooping mournful fringes that ended in tassels tumbling\nover the shafts. Dead children had a little white hearse with white\nponies and white nets and plumes. Funerals were made as slow and\nnodding and mournful as possible.\nEvery friend of the dead who owned a chaise or buggy and some\nhired hacks joined in the procession. Nobody thought of crossing\nthe path of a funeral; people stood holding their hats in their hands\nwith heads bowed patiently until the procession had passed. People\ndrew down their front blinds as a funeral passed their houses. In\nVictoria the dead were buried as leisurely as the living lived.\nThe first graves in Ross Bay Cemetery looked very lonely and far\napart, because Episcopalians could not lie beside Nonconformists,\nnor could Catholics rest beside Episcopalians. Methodists, Chinese,\npaupers buried by the City and people who believed in nothing at\nall, had to lie each in a separate part of the cemetery.\nThere were wide, gravelled driveways among the graves. Some of\nthe graves were like little, low-walled gardens filled with flowers.\nThis cemetery had a grave-keeper who kept the graves from getting\nmuddled together with weeds and brambles.\nBut the waves of Ross Bay boomed against the cemetery bank and\nbroke it. They bit into the earth, trying to wash out the coffins. They\nseemed to say, “I, the sea, can take better care of you, the dead,\nthan the earth can. My gulls will cry over all of you alike. In me all\ndenominations can mingle.”"

      "title": "Schools",
      "content": "It took a generation and a half for English settlers in Victoria to\naccept the Canadian public school which they insisted on calling\nthe “free school”. They turned their noses up at our public schools\nas if they had been bad smells, preferring to send their children\nto old, ultra-genteel-hard-up English Ladies’ Academies. Of these\nthere were quite a few in Victoria; in them learning was confined to\ngood manners. Politeness-education ladies had migrated to Canada,\noften in the hope of picking up bread and butter and possibly a\nhusband, though they pretended all the while that they had come\nout on a very special mission—to teach the young of English-born\ngentlemen how not to become Canadian, to believe that all niceness\nand goodness came from ancestors and could have nothing to do\nwith the wonderful new land, how not to acquire Colonial\ndeportment, which was looked upon as crude, almost wicked. The\nonly teaching qualifications these ladies possessed, and for their\nservices they charged enormously, had been acquired by\ngenerations of habit.\nSo young ladies whose papas had sufficient means learned English\nmanners—how to shut a door, how to bow gracefully, how to\naddress people of their own class and how a servant, how to write a\ndignified letter in beautiful script, how to hold their heads up, their\nstomachs in and how to look down their noses at the right moment.\nFor all this the old ladies were very handsomely remunerated and\nthe girls’ brains remained quite empty. Canadian public schools\ntaught book learning but no manners to speak of.\nMy parents sent their two eldest daughters to a Ladies’\nDeportment Academy. Their next three children died before they\nwere of school age. We four younger children were sent to the\nPublic School. Father said we could “learn manners at home”, but we\ncould not get education in those days at the private school out west.\nLater, Angela College, a Church School for girls, was built and\nendowed by Lady Burdett-Coutts. A red brick building, it stood\non Church Hill. Education in it was costly. All our friends went to\nAngela College, but Father was by this time so prejudiced against\nprivate schools that he sent us to the Public School and was very\nmuch criticized for doing so. Our manners were watched closely\nand apprehensively by our friends. It hurt Mother but Father was\nproud that all his children, with the exception of me, were good\nstudents by Canadian standards. I hated school with the exception\nof the first two years when, being too young for so long a walk, I\nwent to Mrs. Fraser’s school for little girls near our own house.\nMrs. Fraser had large white teeth, a great many little dogs and a\nbrother, Lennie, who kept house for her while she taught school.\nWe sneaked potatoes out of Lennie’s fry-pan as we trooped through\nthe lean-to kitchen so as not to track dirt into Mrs. Fraser’s front\nhall. The dunce stool was very comfortable—much more so than the\nwooden forms where the good pupils sat; I had ample opportunity\nof knowing. You could almost say the dunce’s stool was specially\nmine.\nThe thing that I loved best at Mrs. Fraser’s school was a big book of\nGrimm’s Fairy Talesowned by a girl called Lizzie. At lunch time out\nin the mint bed in the backyard we went fairy and under the school\ndesk when Mrs. Fraser was busy with a sick dog or a pupil’s mama\nwe seized other snatches.\nBy and by other English settlers began to send their children to\nthe Public School and the High School too; then that old ladies’ type\nof private school faded out of existence because education required\na certain standard set by our Public School system if people\nexpected to obtain positions in Canada.\nThose families who were able to send their sons and daughters to\nEngland to be “finished” did so. They came back more exaggeratedly\nEnglish than the English themselves, “patering” and “matering” their\nfather and mother, saying “Awfully jolly, don’t you know!” and “No,\nnot rawlly!” At first it seemed to us Canadians as if that “No” meant\n“You lie!” By and by, however, we found that i t was only an English\nelegance in vogue just then."

      "title": "Christmas",
      "content": "Victoria Christmas weather was always nippy—generally there was\nsnow. We sewed presents for weeks before Christmas came—kettle\nholders, needle books, penwipers and cross-stitch bookmarkers.\nJust before Christmas we went out into the woods, cut down a fir\ntree and brought i t home so alive still that the warm house fooled\nit into thinking spring had come, and it breathed delicious live pine\nsmell all over the house. We put fir and holly behind all the pictures\nand on the mantlepiece and everywhere.\nPlum puddings were dangling from under the pantry shelf by the\ntails of their boiling cloths. A month ago we had all sat round the\nbreakfast-room table, stoning raisins while someone read a story\naloud. Everyone had given the pudding a good-luck stir before it\nwent into the bowls and was tied down and boiled for hours in the\ncopper wash-boiler while spicy smells ran all over the house. On\nChristmas Day the biggest pudding came out for a final boil before\nbeing brought to the table with brandy fire leaping up its sides from\nthe dish, and with a sprig of holly scorching and crackling on its top.\nChristmas Eve Father took us into town to see the shops lit up.\nEvery lamp post had a fir tree tied to it—not corpsy old trees but\nfresh cut firs. Victoria streets were dark; this made the shops look\nall the brighter. Windows were decorated with mock snow made of\ncotton wool and diamond dust. Drygoods shops did not have much\nthat was Christmassy to display except red flannel and rabbit fur\nbaby coats and muffs and tippets. Chemists had immense globes\nof red, green and blue medicine hanging from brass chains in their\nshop windows. I wished some of us could be sick enough for Dr.\nHelmcken to prescribe one of the splendid globes for us. The\nchemists also showed coloured soap and fancy perfume in bottles.\nCastor oil in hideous blue bottles peered from behind nice\nChristmas things and threw out hints about over-eating and\nstomach-ache. A horrid woman once told my mother that she let\nher children eat everything they wanted on Christmas Day and\nfinished them up with a big dose of castor oil. Mr. Hibben, the\nstationer, was nicer than that woman and the chemist. He hid all\nthe school books behind story books left open at the best pictures.\nHe had “Merry Christmas” in cotton wool on red cardboard in his\nwindow.\nIt was the food shops that Merry Christmassed the hardest. In\nMr. Saunders’, the grocer’s, window was a real Santa Claus grinding\ncoffee. The wheel was bigger than he was. He had a long beard\nand moved his hands and his head. As the wheel went round the\ncoffee beans went in, got ground, and came out, smell and all. In\nthe window all round Santa were bonbons, cluster raisins, nuts\nand candied fruit, besides long walking-sticks made of peppermint\ncandy. Next to this splendid window came Goodacre’s horrible\nbutcher shop—everything in it dead and naked. Dead geese and\nturkeys waggled, head down; dead beeves, calves and pigs straddled\nbetween immense meat hooks on the walls; naked sheep had\nbunches of coloured paper where their heads ought to have been\nand flowers and squiggles carved in the fat of their backs. Creatures\nthat still had their heads on stared out of eyes like poached eggs\nwhen the white has run over the yolk. Baby pigs looked worst of\nall—pink and naked as bathing babies, their cheeks drawn back to\nmake them smile at the red apples which had been forced into\ntheir toothless, sucking mouths. The shop floor was strewn deep in\nsawdust to catch blood drips. You heard no footsteps in the shop,\nonly the sharpening of knives, sawing of bones, and bump, bump of\nthe scale. Everybody was examining meat and saying, “Compliments\nof the Season” to everyone else, Father saying, “Fine display,\nGoodacre, very fine indeed!” We children rushed out and went back\nto Santa while Father chose his meat.\nThe shop of old George, the poulterer, was nearly as bad as\nGoodacre’s, only the dead things did not look so dead, nor stare so\nhard, having shut the grey lids over their eyes to die. They were\nlimp in necks and stiff in legs. As most of them had feathers on\nthey looked like birds still, whereas the butcher’s creatures had been\nrushed at once from life to meat.\nThe food shops ended the town, and after that came Johnson\nStreet and Chinatown, which was full of black night. Here we turned\nback towards James’ Bay, ready for bed.\nThere was a high mantlepiece in the breakfast room. And while we\nwere hanging our stockings from it my sister read:\n“’Twas the night before Christmas\nand all through the house\nNot a creature was stirring, not even a\nmouse.”\nOn the way to bed we could smell our Christmas tree waiting in\nthe dining-room. The room was all dark but we knew that i t stood\non the floor and touched the ceiling and that it hung heavy with\npresents, ready for tomorrow. When the lights were lit there would\nbe more of them than any of us children could count. We would all\ntake hands and sing carols round the tree; Bong would come in and\nlook with his mouth open. There was always things on it for him\nbut he would not wait to get his presents. He would run back to his\nkitchen and we would take them to him there. It seemed as if Bong\nfelt too Chinese to Christmas with us in our Canadian way.\nThe Presbyterian Church did not have service on Christmas\nmorning so we went to the Reformed Episcopal with my sister;\nFather stayed home with Mother.\nAll the week before Christmas we had been in and out of a sort\nof hole under the Reformed Church, sewing twigs of pine onto long\nstrips of brown paper. These were to be put round the church\nwindows, which were very high. It was cold under the church and\nbadly lighted. We all sneezed and hunted round for old boards to put\nbeneath our feet on the earth floor under the table where we sat\npricking ourselves with holly, and getting stuck up with pine gum.\nThe prickings made the ladies’ words sharp—that and their sniffy\ncolds and remembering all the work to be done at home. Everything\nunusual was fun for us children. We felt important helping to\ndecorate the Church.\nPresent-giving was only done to members in one’s immediate\nfamily. Others you gave love and a card to, and kissed the people you\ndid not usually kiss.\nNew Year’s Day had excitement too. It was the custom for ladies\nto stay at home, sitting in their drawing-rooms with decanters of\nwine and fine cakes handy. Gentlemen called to wish them the\n“Compliments of the Season”. Right after lunch we went up to\nMother’s room where you could see farthest down the street, to\nwatch for Mother’s first caller, and it was always the shy Cameron\nbrothers, coming very early so as to avoid other visitors.\nGentlemen paid their respects at Government House, too, on\nNew Year’s Day, and Naval officers made a point of returning the\nhospitality of those who had entertained them while stationed in\nVictoria."

      "title": "Regatta",
      "content": "The beautiful Gorge waters were smooth as glass once Victoria\nHarbour had been crossed. The Gorge was an arm of the sea which\nran into the land for three miles. Near its head was a narrow rocky\npass with a hidden rock in the centre which capsized many a canoe\nand marooned many a picnic party above the Gorge until long after\nmidnight, for when the tide was running in or out through the pass\nthere was a four-foot fall with foam and great roaring. A bridge\nran across from one side of the Gorge to the other, high above the\nwater. The banks on both sides of the Arm were heavily wooded; a\nfew fine homes snuggled among the trees and had gardens running\nto the water. Most of the other property was public—anyone could\npicnic on it.\nThe waters of the Gorge were much warmer than the water of the\nbeaches round Victoria. Jones’s Boathouse beside James’ Bay Bridge\nrented out boats and canoes; many people living along the harbour\nfront had boathouses and boats of their own, for regattas and water\nsports were one of Victoria’s chief attractions. Visitors came from\nVancouver and from the States on the 24th of May to see them.\nThe Navy and the Indian tribes up and down the Coast took\npart in the races, the Navy rowing their heavy ships’ boats round\nfrom Esquimalt Harbour, manned by bluejackets, while smart little\npinnaces “pip-pipped” along commanded by young midshipmen.\nThe Indians came from long distances in their slender, racing\ndugout canoes—ten paddles and a steersman to each canoe.\nThe harbour was gay with flags. Races started from the Gorge\nBridge at 1 P.M. Our family went to the Regatta with Mr. and Mrs.\nBales. Mr. Bales had a shipyard just below Point Ellice Bridge, at\nthe beginning of the Arm waters. We got into Mr. Bales’ boat at the\nshipyard where unfinished boats stood all round us just above high\ntide. They looked as we felt when we shivered in our nightgowns on\nBeacon Hill beaches waiting for the courage to dip into the sea. But\nrosy-faced Mr. Bales eased his boats gently into the water; he did\nnot seize and duck them as my big sister did us.\nWhen the picnic was all stowed into Mr. Bales’ boat we pushed\nout into the stream and joined the others—sail boats, canoes, rafts\nand fish boats, all nosing their way up the Gorge along with the\nnaval boats and war canoes. There were bands and mouth-organs,\nconcertinas and flags. The Indian families in their big canoes glided\nvery quietly except for an occasional yapping from one of their dogs\nwhen he saw a foe in another canoe.\nThere was the hollow rumble of traffic over Point Ellice Bridge as\nwe passed under it. Dust sprinkled down between the planks and\nfell on us. Out-of-town people came to the Regatta in wagons and\nbuggies, driving up the Gorge Road on one side of the Arm or the\nCraigflower Road on the other side, tying their horses in the bush\nand carrying their picnic baskets through the woods to the shore.\nPeople lit small fires and picnicked near the water’s edge where they\ncould see the races pass.\nThe races started from the Gorge Bridge, came down the Arm,\nturned round Deadman’s Island, an old Indian burial ground, and\nreturned to the bridge.\nThe Indian canoe races were the most exciting of all the Regatta.\nTen paddles dipped as one paddle, ten men bent as one man, while\nthe steersman kept time for them with grunting bows. The men\nhad bright coloured shirts and gay head-bands; some even had\npainted faces. The Kloochman’s was an even grander race than the\nIndian men’s. Solid, earnest women with gay shawls wound round\ntheir middles gave every scrap of themselves to the canoe; it came\nalive and darted through the water like a flash, foam following the\npaddles. The dips, heaves and grunts of all the women were only one\ndip, heave and grunt. Watchers from the banks yelled; the Indians\nwatched from their canoes by the shore, with an intent, silent stare.\nThe Bluejacket Races were fine, too. Each boat was like a stout,\nbrave monster, enduring and reliable—the powerful, measured\nstrokes of the British Navy, sure and unerring as the earth itself, not\nlike the cranky war canoes, flashing through their races like running\nfire.\nAt the end of the Regatta came something mean and cruel. An old\nhulk was towed to midstream; a long pole hung over the water at\none end of her, and, suspended from its tip, was a crate crammed\nfull of agonized pig squeals. The pole was greased and men tried to\nwalk out to the end of i t and dislodge the crate. The pole was supple,\nthe crate swayed as each man crept out clinging desperately and\nfinally fell off into the sea. The terrified pig in the crate squealed.\nPeople roared with laughter and greasers applied fresh grease for\nthe next person’s try. When at last a man was successful and with\na great splash crate and pig plunged into the sea, sailors hurried to\npull it into a boat before the poor pig drowned.\nThe band blared, “God Save The Queen” and everyone on the\nbanks and in the boats raised their hats and sang with the band.\n“Queen! Queen!” echoed back from the trees and the rocks.\nThe wet, shivering pig in his crate did not care whether the Queen\nwere saved or not. “God saveme!” was his imploring squeal."

      "content": "Strange characters came to little Victoria. It seemed as if people\nwho could not fit in anywhere else arrived here sooner or later till\nVictoria poked, bulged and hollowed over queer shapes of strange\npeople, as a snake, swallowing its food whole, looks lumpy during\ndigestion. Victoria had some hard lumps to digest.\nSometimes they came, hurried by a firm push from behind given\nby relatives in the Old Country, around whose necks they had hung\ntoo heavily for many years, and who said, “Now that travel is so\neasy, why not, dear? . . . Door to door without a stop! . . . Such an\nadventure! Victoria is a crown colony, not Canadian—try it, darling!”\nSo the “darlings” whose lives from birth had been humdrum,\nespecially since the rest of the family had married and left the old\nhome to them and nothing for its upkeep, nibbled at the thought,\ngrabbed for the word “adventure”, sold up and sailed. Relatives saw\nthem off, calling them “old sports”, begging them to write—they,\nwho had never had anything to write about in their whole lives were\nnow launched proudly into adventure.\nSometimes it was a bachelor brother and spinster sister of the\nglued-together type of family remnants.\nAfter the whistle shrieked every mile of water washed the old land\naway fainter and fainter and hurried them into the unknown. They\nbegan to ache—such vast quantities of water! Such vast quantities\nof land! The ache grew and grew. By and by they saw the western\nforests and the little town of Victoria drowned in silent loneliness;\nthere was then no describing how they felt. They rented\nuncomfortable, mean little cottages or shacks and did with\nincompetent hands what well-trained Old Country servants had all\ntheir lives done for them. Too late! Turning back was impossible; the\nold home was sold, its price already seeping away too fast. There\nwere many of these sad people in Victoria, shuddering when they\nsaw a Western funeral, thinking of the cosiness of Old Country\nchurchyards.\nThere were maiden aunts, who had attached themselves to the\nfamily circle of a married brother and who undertook the diction\nand deportment of his children, bitterly regretting the decision of\nBrother to migrate to Canada, but never for one moment faltering\nin their duty to Brother’s family, standing between his children and\ncolonialism. The Maiden Aunts swallowed their crosses with a\ndifficult gulp. Auntie’s job was discounted in the New World;\nCanadian-born children soon rebelled at her tyranny. She sank into\na wilted, homesick derelict, sniffling by the fireside while the\nmother learned more or less to work with her own hands, so that\nshe could instruct what Auntie called her “heathen help” in kitchen\nlow art. Auntie herself refused to acknowledge base presences such\nas cook-stoves and wash-tubs.\nIn our family there were no maiden aunts. Our delicate little\nMother had six living children and three dead ones and, with the\nhelp of her older daughters and the Chinese boy, Bong, we managed\nvery comfortably without aunts. Many a useless servant-dependent\nwoman from the Old Country was shown by my mother how to use\nher own hands and her own brain in her Canadian home with no\nother help than green Chinese boys.\nIn Toronto Street over James’ Bay way there lived a most\nastonishing family, c onsisting of t wo brothers, Fat O’Flahty and Lean\nO’Flahty and a sister, Miss O’Flahty. All were above middle age.\nThey built a shanty entirely of driftwood which they gathered and\nhauled from the beach. They might be seen any hour of the day\nor night trundling logs home on a wheel-barrow, taking long rests\non its handle while they smoked a pipe. The brothers never sawed\nthe driftwood but used it any length, just as it came out of the\nsea—mostly longish, round tree trunks rubbed smooth by rocks and\nsea on their long swims, where from no one knew.\nThe O’Flahty’s house looked like a bonfire heaped ready for\nlighting. The only place where the wood of the entire shanty was\nhalf-way level was at the ground and even there it was bumpy. The\nup ends of all the logs higgledy-piggledied into the sky, some logs\nlong, some short. The door was made of derelict planks gathered\non the beach, too, and the roof was of anything at all—mostly of tin\ncans. It had a stovepipe sticking through the top. The fence round\nthe O’Flahty’s small piece of ground was built to match the house.\nThe O’Flahtys had lived in this strange house for some years\nwhen Mother heard that Miss O’Flahty was very ill. She sent us post\nhaste down, with some soup. We knocked on the gate which was\npadlocked. Fat O’Flahty came and let us in. We walked on a plank up\nto the door which was also padlocked.\n“She’s bad,” he said and led the way into the shanty.\nIt was nearly dark and very smoky. I n the centre of the one room\nstood a jumble of drift logs standing upright to make a little room.\nFat O’Flahty moved two logs aside and, when we were accustomed\nto the dark, we saw a white patch lying in the corner. I t was Miss\nO’Flahty’s face. Her bed was made of logs too. It was built on the\nfloor and had no legs. There was no space for us to step inside Miss\nO’Flahty’s bedroom. There was scarcely room for even our looks to\nsqueeze in.\nFat O’Flahty behind my sister said, “Does she look awful sick?”\nand Lean O’Flahty, peering behind Fat with some of the soup in a\ntin cup, said also, “Does she seem turrible bad?” Their voices were\nfrightened. Lean O’Flahty held the tin cup of soup towards the sick\nwoman. The dim patch of white face in the corner shook a feeble\n“No.” The brothers groaned.\nMiss O’Flahty died. Lean and Fat had her embalmed and put her\ninto a handsome casket. She rode to the Outer Wharf in the same\nwheel-barrow which had lugged their building wood from the\nbeach. The brothers trundled it. We were down at the Outer Wharf,\nseeing Auntie away by the San Francisco boat. “Ouch! It’s a coffin!”\nsquealed Auntie as her cloak brushed it. Fat and Lean O’Flahty were\nsitting one on either handle of the barrow, crying. When all were\naboard, the brothers, each with a fist in his eye and with loud sniffs,\nwheeled the coffin down between decks and the O’Flahty family\ndisappeared. Next time we passed down Toronto Street their crazy\nhouse was gone too.\nAnother human derelict was Elizabeth Pickering—she wore a\nbright red shawl and roamed the streets of Victoria, intoxicated\nmost of the time. Occasionally she sobered briefly and went to the\nkindly Bishop to ask help. The Bishop handed her over to his maiden\nsister who specialized in correction. Elizabeth would settle herself\ncomfortably, drawing a chair to the fire to toast her toes and doze\ntill she became thirsty again. Then, with a great yawn, she would\nreach for the little packages the Bishop’s wife had put near her\non the table. Regardless of whether Aunt Cridge had finished her\nlecture on drink or not she would rise with a sympathetic, “Feelin’\nyer rheumatics today, baint ye, pore soul? Me and you suffers the\nsame—its crool!”\nOld Teenie was another familiar figure of our school days. Teenie\nwas half-negro—half crazy. Her hut was on Fort Street in the centre\nof a rough field and lay a little below street level. Boys used to throw\nstones onto her tin roof and then run away. Out came old Teenie,\nbuzzing mad as a whole nest of wasps. Muttered awfulnesses came\nfrom her great padded bonnet. It shook, her tatters shook, so did\nwisps of grey hair and old Teenie’s pair of tiny black fists.\nI don’t know who looked after Teenie. She scoured with stick and\nsack the ditches and empty lots, putting oddments into her sack,\nshaking her stick at everyone, muttering, always muttering.\nNobody questioned where these derelicts came from. They were\ntaken as much for granted as the skunk-cabbages in our swamps.\nVictoria’s queer people were not all poor, either—there were\ndoddering old gentlemen. I can remember them driving about\nVictoria in their little buggies—the fatter the man, the smaller the\nbuggy! They had old nursemaid horses who trundled them as\nfaithfully as any mammy does her baby in its pram. Every day, wet\nor fine, the horses aired their old men on Dallas Road. Knowing that\ntheir charges slept through the entire outing, the faithful creatures\nnever moved from the middle of the road nor changed from a slow\nwalk. The public also knew by the lolling heads and slack reins that\nthe old men slept and gave their buggies right of way. Street traffic\nwas not heavy, time no object. Chaises, gentlemen’s high dog-carts\npassed the nursemaid horses briskly. The dog-carts paused at road-\nhouse bars and again overtook the patient plodding horses who\nwalked their charges to a certain tree on Foul Bay Road, circled it\nand strolled home again just as the old men’s Chinese cooks put\ntheir dinner on the table. The old horses were punctual to the dot.\nOne of these old men was very fond of children. When he met\nus, if he happened to be awake, he pulled up with a wheezy “Whoa”,\nmeant both for us and for his horse. Taking a screw of paper from\nhis pocket he bent over the wheel and gave us each a lollipop and\na smile. He was so ugly that we were afraid, but Mother, who knew\nwho he was told us he loved children and that it was all right. If,\nhowever, we saw his buggy coming in time we hid until it was past;\nhe was such a very ugly old man!\nA family we knew had one of those “Papa’s-sister” Aunts who\ntook it upon herself to be a corrector of manners not only for\nher own nieces but for young Canadians in general. In fact she\naspired to introduce elegance into the Far West. This elegant and\nenergetic lady walked across Beacon Hill at seven-thirty on fine\nsummer mornings, arriving at our house in time for family prayers\nand breakfast. In spite of her erect carriage she could flop to her\nknees to pray as smart as any of us. That over, she kissed us all\nround, holding each at arm’s length and with popping, piercing eyes,\ncriticized our tooth-brushing, our hair ribbons, our finger nails,\nrecommended that we eat more porridge or less, told Mother to\ngive us no raw fruit at all, always to stew it, no stone fruit at all,\nno candy, told us never to ask for second helps, but wait to be\ninvited, had us do a little English pronouncing, then, having made us\nlate, said, “Hurry! hurry! Lateness is unpardonable, dears! Ladies are\nnever late.”\nThen there were Brother Charlie and Sister Tilly, evidently sworn\neach to see other into the grave. This pair minced up Birdcage\nWalk like elderly fowls, holding their heads each a little to one\nside—Charlie so that Tilly’s lips could reach his deaf ear, Tilly so that\nshe might direct her shriek straight into Charlie’s drum. The harder\nshe shrieked the higher she squeaked. Charlie, on the other hand,\nwas far too gentlemanly to speak in public places above a whisper\nwhich he could not hear himself, so he felt it safest always to say\n“Yes, yes, dear Tilly” or “Exactly so, Tilly dear” when he should often\nhave said, “No, Tilly, certainly not!”\nBrother and sister whispered and squeaked up Birdcage Walk\nwhere they lived. They hopped up the two steps to the inset door of\ntheir cottage and cooed themselves in.\n“Yes, yes, dear Tilly, yes!”"

The Grove had not the sombre weight that\nbelongs to the forest, nor had it the bare coldness of a windswept\nclearing. It was beautifully half real, like the place you fall into after\nthe candle is blown out, and sleep is just taking hold of you.\nVictoria had to be specially loyal because she was named after\nthe Queen. To her the most important day, after Christmas Day of\ncourse, was the Queen’s Birthday, on the twenty-fourth of May. We\nmade more fuss over the Queen’s Birthday than did any other town\nin Canada.\nMay is just about our most lovely month. The lilacs, the hawthorn,\nthe laburnums and the broom are all in blossom, just begging the\nkeen Spring winds to let their petals hang on till after the twenty-\nfourth so that Victoria can look most splendid for the Queen’s\nBirthday. On the twenty-third, one often had to stand on the\nchopping block and, hanging onto the verandah post with rain\nspittering in your face, sing right up into the sky—\n“Rain, rain go away.\nCome again another day\nWhen I cook and when I\nbake\nI’ll send you up a patty-\ncake.”\nSometimes the rain listened, sometimes it did not. But most of our\ntwenty-fourths were fine which was lucky because on the Queen’s\nBirthday we wore our Summer frocks for the first time.\nMother prepared a splendid picnic. Father left his business frown\nand his home sternness behind him. Rugs, food and the black billy\nfor making tea, were packed into the old baby buggy and we\ntrundled it straight down Simcoe Street. Simcoe Street passed the\nside of our place and ended in Medina’s Grove. In May, what with\nthe new green on the bushes, the Medina’s calves skipping about,\nand Medina Grove birds nesting, it was like fairy land. Sea air blew in\nfrom the beach, just one field away! Seagulls swooped down to look\nfor picnic bits. The ground was all bumpy from being crowded with\nmore new grass than the cows could eat. There were some big trees\nin the Grove, but not thick enough to keep the sun out. Every kind\nof delicious spring smell was there. It was not like being in a garden\nto play; the Grove was gently wild but had not the awe of the forest.\nBushes grew here in little groups like families. Each picnic could\nhave its own place quite private; just the laughs tumbled through\nthe bushes and mixed. There were no gates to remember to shut,\nno flowerbeds you must not scoot across. You might pick anything\nyou liked and eat as much picnic as you could. These Medina Grove\npicnics were our first Queen’s Birthdays. By and by we grew older\nand steady enough to sit still in boats; then we went to regattas, up\nthe Arm, on the twenty-fourth. The Queen’s Birthday changed then.\nIt was not so much our own day. A shadowy little old lady owned it.\nThis Queen, after whom Victoria was named, did not mean any\nmore to me than a name. The older ones knew all about her and\nso I suppose they thought I did. It was Mrs. Mitchell who made\nthe Royal Family stop being fairy and turned Royalty into real live\npeople for me. Mrs. Mitchell was a little, frail, old woman. Henry,\nher husband, was an English nurseryman. They came from England\nand started a nursery garden not far from our house, at the time\nwhen farm land was being cut into small personal pieces. Mother\nwent to see any new people who came to live near us, if she saw that\nthey were lonely and homesick. Mrs. Mitchell was very homesick\nand very lonely. She said she loved me from the first time my Mother\ntook me to see her, because I was fat and rosy just like an English\nchild. But I was not an English child and I didn’t love her because she\nwas English. I loved Mrs. Mitchell because she loved creatures, and\nI loved her garden, too, with its long rows of nursery stock, and its\nbeds of pinks and mignonette. Mrs. Mitchell was gentle, small and\nfrail. She had a little weak voice, which squeaked higher and higher\nthe more she loved. Her guinea fowl and I cracked it altogether.\nShe had four speckled guinea fowl—she and Henry loved them as if\nthey had been real children. They opened the door of their cottage\nand called, “Coom, coom, coom, pretty little dears”—and the guineas\ncame mincing through the kitchen into the sitting-room, and\njumped into their laps.\nThe Mitchells’ nursery garden was next to a farm rented by Jim\nPhillips. Jim got angry because the guinea fowl flew over the fence\ninto his grain field and he shot three of them. The old couple cried\nand cried. They took it to law and got the price of the guineas but\nthe price of the birds’ flesh meant nothing to them. It was the life\ngone from their birds that they cried for. Never having any children\nthe guineas had been next best. This last bird of their four they\nnever let out of their sight. Jim Phillips was furious that he had had\nto pay for the bodies of the other three especially as he knew it was\nonly for love, not value, that they cried.\nMrs. Mitchell cuddled the last bird in her little black silk apron\nand bowing her head on his speckled back cried into his feathers\nmournfully rocking him and herself. She took the little pink bow\nout of her black lace cap and its long black ties dropped over her\nshoulders as she bent crying. There was always a little bunch of\neverlasting flowers sewn into her cap over one ear, brittle, dried up\nlittle things like chrysalises; she let these be. She had a whole floor\nof everlasting flowers spread to dry in her front room. They smelled\nlike hay and were just as much alive after they had been dead for\na whole year. She made wreaths of them for funerals. Everlasting\nflowers reminded people there was no death, she said.\nI went very often to Mrs. Mitchell to try to cheer her over the\nguinea fowl, but it seemed I could not cheer her at all. The remaining\nguinea’s wings were all drooped with loneliness and she held him\nin her lap nearly all day. I looked around the sitting-room to find\nsomething happy to say. The walls were covered with pictures of\ngentlemen and ladies cut out of the London News and the Daily\nGraphic. Grand ladies with frizzled hair and lots of necklaces, men\nwith medals on and sashes across their chests.\n“Q-u-e-e-n V-i-c-t-o-r-i-a”, I spelled out.\n“Is that the lady who has the twenty-fourth of May birthday?”\n“Yes, my dear,” Mrs. Mitchell sniffled into the guinea’s feathers.\n“Yes, our most gracious Queen Victoria.”\n“Who is the man beside her?”\n“The late Prince Consort, my dear, and this is the Princess Royal,\nand here is the Prince of Wales and Princess Beatrice.”\n“Whoarethese people?” I asked. “I thought Princes and\nPrincesses just belonged to fairy tales. What have they to do with\nQueen Victoria?”\nMrs. Mitchell was very much shocked indeed. She stopped crying\nand, using the guinea fowl as a pointer, she went from picture to\npicture telling the bird and me who all the Royalties were, how old,\nwhom they had married and so on. At last we came to a lady in a\nblack frame with a bow of crêpe over the top of i t and a bunch of\neverlasting flowers underneath. “Princess Alice”, said Mrs. Mitchell\nwith a long, long sniffle, “now a blessed saint,” and she began to cry\nall over again.\nI thought these picture people must be relatives of Mrs. Mitchell’s,\nshe seemed to know them so well and cried so hard about Alice.\nThe Queen’s picture was everywhere. I knew she was someone\ntremendous, though to me she had been vague and far off like Job\nor St. Paul. I had never known she was real and had a family, only\nthat she owned Victoria, Canada, and the twenty-fourth of May, the\nChurch of England and all the soldiers and sailors in the world. Now\nsuddenly she became real—a woman like Mother with a large family.\nMrs. Mitchell took a great deal of pains to get the Royal family\nstraight in my head and it was lucky she did, because who should\ncome out to Canada, to Victoria, that very year and pay a long visit\nto Government House, but the Princess Louise and the Marquis of\nLorne! This excited Mrs. Mitchell so that she stopped crying. She,\nwho never went out, found a bonnet that I had never seen before,\nput a dolman over her best silk dress, locked the guinea fowl safe\nin her kitchen and got into a hack with Henry, her smelling-bottle\nand her cap, in which was a new bunch of everlasting flowers. The\ncap was in a paper bag on Henry’s knee. They drove to the house\nof Dr. Ashe on Fort Street where the procession was to pass and\nsat in a bow window and waved at the Princess. When she saw the\nPrincess smiling and dressed in gay colours, she realized that her\nbeloved Princess Alice had been dead longer than she thought and\nthat Court mourning was finished. She went home and took the\ncrêpe off Alice but she left the everlasting flowers.\nMrs. Mitchell watched the papers for every crumb of news of\nher Princess while the visitors were in Victoria—how she had gone\nsketching in the Park, how she used to go into the shops and chat\nwith people; how once she went into a bake-shop to buy some cakes\nand stepped behind the counter to point out the kind to the baker\nwho ordered her back, saying gruffly, “Nobody ain’t allowed behind\nmy counter, mum,” and then when she gave the address, the baker\nnearly died of shame and so did Mrs. Mitchell as she read it.\nSeeing Royalty waked again all Mrs. Mitchell’s homesickness for\nEngland. They sold everything and she and Henry went back to the\nOld Country to die. She gave me a doctor’s book on diseases and an\nempty box with a lock and key. I did not like the disease book and\ncould never find anything important enough to lock up in the box;\nso I put it away on a high shelf. Mrs. Mitchell cried dreadfully when\nshe left Victoria but kept saying “I’m going home, my dear, going\nhome.”\nThe journey nearly killed her, and England did quite. All her people\nwere dead except distant cousins. England was different from what\nshe had remembered. She sent me Gray’sElegy in a Country\nChurchyardand Henry wrote saying she was crying for me and for\nVictoria now as she had cried for England and Princess Alice and\nthe guinea fowl. Then came a silver and black card “In Memoriam to\nAnne Mitchell”—then I had something to lock away in the little box,\nwith a little bunch of everlasting flowers, the last that Mrs. Mitchell\ngave me."

If he was wanted in a hurry he got there in no\ntime and did not wait for you to become sicker so that he could\nmake a bigger cure. You began to get better the moment you heard\nDr. Helmcken coming up the stairs. He did have the most horrible\nmedicines—castor oil, Gregory’s powder, blue pills, black draughts,\nsulphur and treacle.\nJokey people called him Dr. Heal-my-skin. He had been Doctor in\nthe old Fort and knew everybody in Victoria. He was very thin, very\nactive, very cheery. He had an old brown mare called Julia. When the\nDoctor came to see Mother we fed Julia at the gate with clover. The\nDoctor loved old Julia. One stormy night he was sent for because\nMother was very ill. He came very quickly and Mother said, “I am\nsorry to bring you and Julia out on such a night, Doctor.”\n“Julia is in her stable. What was the good of t wo of us getting wet?”\nhe replied.\nMy little brother fell across a picket fence once and tore his leg.\nThe Doctor put him on our dining-room sofa and sewed it up. The\nChinaboy came rushing in to say, “House all burn up!” Dr. Helmcken\nput in the last stitch, wiped his needle on his coat sleeve and put\nit into his case, then, stripping off his coat, rushed to the kitchen\npump and pumped till the fire was put out.\nOnce I knelt on a needle which broke into my knee.
