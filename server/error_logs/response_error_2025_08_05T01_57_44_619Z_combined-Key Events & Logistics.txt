  "notes": "## Key Events & Logistics\n\nThis module outlines essential events, procedures, and logistical information crucial for cadets, especially during their first year. Understanding these aspects ensures smooth integration into cadet life and adherence to institutional expectations.\n\n### 1. Parades and Formal Retreats\n*   **Nature:** These are highly ceremonial events that are integral to the cadet experience.\n*   **Purpose:** They serve to uphold tradition, demonstrate discipline, and honor the military heritage of the institution.\n*   **Frequency/Significance:** Cadets are expected to participate regularly, as these events are a fundamental part of cadet life and training.\n\n### 2. Caldwell March\n*   **Participants:** This event is specifically for first-year cadets.\n*   **Significance:** It is described as the 'first-year cadet training capstone.' This means it is the culminating event or a significant milestone marking the completion of their initial training period.\n*   **Nature:** Likely a physically and mentally challenging event designed to test and solidify their training.\n\n### 3. Home Football Games\n*   **Attendance:** Attendance at home football games is **mandatory** for all cadets.\n*   **Seating:** Cadets have specific seating arrangements, which are typically designated sections where the entire corps sits together to demonstrate unity and support.\n*   **Purpose:** These games are not just recreational; they are opportunities to foster camaraderie, school spirit, and represent the corps publicly.\n\n### 4. Mail and Package Delivery Procedures\n*   **Two Primary Systems:** Cadets utilize two main systems for mail and package delivery:\n    *   **CLMS Address:** This is a specific mailing address system tailored for cadet-related mail and packages. It's designed to streamline delivery to the cadet corps.\n    *   **VT Mail Services:** This refers to the general university mail services, used for standard university business and possibly for non-cadet specific personal mail.\n*   **Package Pickup:** Packages sent to cadets, regardless of the system used, typically require pickup at a designated location (e.g., a central mail center or cadet specific mailroom), rather than direct delivery to dorm rooms.\n*   **Distinction:** It's critical to use the correct address (CLMS or VT Mail Services) depending on the nature of the mail or package to ensure proper delivery.\n\n### 5. Parking Information for Families on Campus\n*   **Target Audience:** This information is specifically for families or visitors who are driving to campus.\n*   **Key Aspects:** It would include details on:\n    *   **Designated Parking Areas:** Where visitors are permitted to park.\n    *   **Permit Requirements:** Whether temporary permits are needed and how to obtain them.\n    *   **Restrictions:** Awareness of parking restrictions, especially during large events like football games or move-in/out days, is crucial to avoid citations.",
