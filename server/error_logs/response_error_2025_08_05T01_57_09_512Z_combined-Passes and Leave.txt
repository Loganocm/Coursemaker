  "notes": "## Passes and Leave: Essential Guidelines for Student Travel\n\nThis chapter outlines the regulations and types of permissions required for students to leave the campus premises. Understanding the distinctions between different pass types and specific conditions like 'Closed Weekends' is crucial for compliance.\n\n### 1. Distinction Between Pass and Leave\n*   **Pass:** Permits travel **within 50 miles** of the campus.\n    *   Generally for shorter excursions or visits to nearby areas.\n*   **Leave:** Permits travel **beyond 50 miles** from the campus.\n    *   Required for longer trips or visits to destinations further away.\n\n### 2. Closed Weekends\n*   **Definition:** Specific weekends designated by the institution where mandatory events or activities are scheduled.\n*   **Travel Restriction:** During 'Closed Weekends,' passes and leaves are generally **not allowed**.\n*   **Exceptions:** Very limited and require specific, pre-approved circumstances or emergencies.\n\n### 3. Types of Travel Permissions\n*   **Regular Pass:**\n    *   The standard permission for travel within the 50-mile radius.\n    *   Specific duration and return times will be stipulated.\n*   **Regular Leave:**\n    *   The standard permission for travel beyond the 50-mile radius.\n    *   Requires more detailed planning and approval due to the greater distance.\n*   **Family Pass:**\n    *   A special type of pass that allows for **overnight stays with family members**.\n    *   Typically still falls within the 50-mile 'pass' radius, but the key distinction is the permission for overnight accommodation away from campus.\n\n### 4. University Holidays\n*   **Significance:** Periods of academic break where students may be granted extended passes or leaves.\n*   **Planning:** Students are encouraged to plan their travel arrangements well in advance for university holidays, adhering to any specific procedures.\n\n### 5. Travel Plans After Finals\n*   **Departure Planning:** Students are required to make concrete travel plans for departure from campus **immediately after their final examinations**.\n*   **Procedures:** Specific institutional procedures for post-finals travel, including deadlines for vacating residences, must be followed.",
