# Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Family Guide 2024-2025

## Module 1: Understanding the Corps Program & Structure

### notes - This module introduces the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC), distinguishing it as one of the nation's six Senior Military Colleges (SMCs). Unlike standalone military academies, VTCC is unique as one of the SMCs integrated within a large public university, providing both military and traditional college experiences. It clarifies that VTCC is a state university program, separate from federal ROTC programs, though ROTC enrollment requires Corps membership. The Corps offers two distinct tracks: the Military-Leader Track for commissioning into services and the Citizen-Leader Track for private and public sector careers, allowing flexibility for cadets to switch between them. A key takeaway is the Corps' commitment to developing global, ethical leaders with high standards of performance and conduct. The organizational structure highlights deputy commandants as primary points of contact for families, responsible for supervision, mentorship, counseling, and discipline. Families are informed about FERPA guidelines, which restrict the sharing of confidential student information like grades or health details without the cadet's consent. The guide emphasizes the importance of family support in helping cadets navigate challenges and maintain a long-range perspective on their choices within the demanding military-like construct, reinforcing the Corps' values.

Academic success is supported through dedicated study periods like Evening Call-to-Quarters (ECQ) and access to university-wide resources such as the Student Success Center, Writing Center, and Career and Professional Development. New cadets benefit from specialized leader development courses, including a focus on transition skills like note-taking and time management, guided by successful cadet academic staff (company S-5). The Corps offers a minor in leadership studies, integrating Corps/ROTC courses, business/ethics courses, and approved leadership roles, and collaborates with the Virginia Tech Honors College. Leadership development follows a progressive four-year model, emphasizing self-leadership, leading people, leading organizations, and leading for the future, with a learn-experience progression each semester. Opportunities for leadership conferences, global experiences like the Global Scholars Program, Olmsted Foundation Undergraduate Scholars, and Project GO enhance cultural understanding and national security perspectives.

## Module 4: Standards, Conduct & Life on Campus

### notes - This module outlines the high standards and strict policies governing cadet conduct, emphasizing the development of the 'Whole Person' through Virginia Tech Student Affairs' Aspirations for Student Learning, which encourage curiosity, integrity, civility, courageous leadership, and service (Ut Prosim). Students are also encouraged to leverage their CliftonStrengths for personal growth and intentional development. Inclusive VT highlights the university's commitment to diversity, belonging, and well-being. Core Corps policies include the strict Honor Code ('A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do.'), zero tolerance for hazing (a criminal offense with severe sanctions), and mutual respect/safety to prevent harassment or assault. The alcohol policy is particularly stringent, with immediate and severe sanctions for underage consumption, irresponsible consumption by legal-age cadets, and possession of false identification, which is also an Honor Code violation. Consequences can range from military probation and scholarship loss to suspension or dismissal, with all incidents impacting ROTC standing. Families are crucial in reinforcing these standards. The withdrawal policy specifies that first-semester cadets wishing to leave the Corps before October 4th must also withdraw from the university for the fall semester. Upper-class and second-semester first-year cadets have more flexibility but may remain in cadet halls if civilian housing isn't available. The module also covers pass and leave policies, differentiating between 'pass' (within 50 miles) and 'leave' (beyond 50 miles), defining 'closed weekends' (mandatory events) when overnight leave is restricted, and explaining regular, family, and holiday leave protocols. Key annual events like parades, Caldwell March, and home football games are mandatory and require cadet attendance in designated areas, with specific mail and package delivery procedures.
