# The Book of Small: A Memoir of Early Victoria

## Module 1: Childhood Sundays and Family Life

### notes - This module delves into the rigid and ritualistic nature of Sundays in the Carr household, offering insights into Victorian-era family dynamics, religious observance, and childhood experiences. Sundays were marked by strict routines, from Saturday night baths and prepared meals to formal church attendance at Dr. Reid's Presbyterian Church, despite Father's partial deafness. The narrative highlights the contrasting religious approaches of Father (stern Presbyterian) and Mother (gentle Anglican), shaping a hybrid religious upbringing for the children. Family prayers and Bible readings were central, often met with childhood boredom and the challenge of remembering sermons. Sunday School, led by the elder sister Dede, emphasized rote learning of texts and hymns. Leisure activities were strictly controlled, with the Sunday walk around the family's English-style grounds providing a rare opportunity for observation. The module also touches upon the children's imaginative play and the strictures against 'pleasuring' on the Sabbath, especially when contrasted with the freedom of other families. The contrast between rigid expectations and childhood desires is a recurring theme, subtly revealing the character of 'Small' and her developing perspectives.

The Cow Yard is depicted as a vibrant, living space, contrasting with the tidier garden favored by her older sister, Bigger. Seasonal events like bonfires, roasted potatoes, and the birth of new animals are highlighted, revealing the children's imaginative play and early aspirations. Small's unique bond with the animals, particularly the Cow and the canary, underscores her empathetic nature. The poignant story of the 'killing tree' (an ivy-strangled tree) introduces themes of death and unanswered childhood questions, reflecting a deeper, unspoken fear.

His property, Beckley Farm, is described as meticulously English in its layout, contrasting with a 'new field' that retained its wild Canadian character. The module highlights Victoria's geographical features, including James' Bay, Dallas Road, and Beacon Hill Park, showcasing natural beauty alongside man-made structures like sailor graves and coastal cannons. The pervasive silence of the Western forests is emphasized, a stark difference from the bustle of the Old World, and a habitat for silent birds of prey. The section also pays tribute to the early pioneers and their arduous struggle to tame the land, symbolized by the constant battle with roots and undergrowth. Stories of Fort Camosun and early settlers like Mrs. Lewis provide a historical context, painting a picture of a challenging yet exciting frontier life. Small's preference for 'wild, western things' over 'old things' reflects her growing connection to her Canadian home.

Father's wholesale store on Wharf Street provides another window into Victoria's commerce, showcasing his diverse inventory and the presence of Indigenous traders and the store's resident cats. The module explores the evolving neighborhood dynamics with new houses replacing wild fields, signifying Victoria's growth. Social gatherings, such as family evening parties, church conversaziones, and socials, illustrate the community's entertainment and social norms, often driven by English traditions. The role of Chinese 'Chinaboy' servants like Bong and Indian washerwomen like Mary is examined, contrasting their cultural differences and contributions to household life.

Cemeteries are examined, from the old, wild Quadra Street one with its Chinese altar, to the new, rigidly segregated Ross Bay Cemetery, highlighting Victorian attitudes towards death and social stratification. The evolution of schooling is presented, contrasting the traditional English 'Ladies' Deportment Academies' focused on manners, with the Canadian public schools emphasizing academic learning. Small's own school experiences, including Mrs. Fraser's unique setting, are shared. Christmas celebrations are meticulously described, from home preparations like plum puddings and tree decorations to the lively, yet sometimes unsettling, town sights like butchers' shops. The annual Regatta on the Gorge waters emerges as a major public event, showcasing naval and Indigenous canoe races, concluding with the cruel 'greased pole' pig contest, revealing a darker aspect of entertainment.

## Module 6: Journeys and Transformations

### notes - This module portrays Small's expanding world as she grows, from her daily walks with Father to the significant transformations shaping Victoria into a modern city. The detailed description of her journey 'From Carr Street to James' Bay' maps out her neighborhood, introducing various eccentric and memorable characters like the Fawcetts, Uncle Jack, Mrs. McConnell, and the Wylies, each contributing to the unique social fabric of early Victoria. These personal encounters, from Mrs. Swannick with no nose to the Johnson girl who silently endured humiliation, offer intimate glimpses into the community's diversity and quirks. The narrative then shifts to 'Grown Up,' chronicling Victoria's grand aspirations and its rivalry with Vancouver. The construction of the magnificent Parliament Buildings, the Empress Hotel, and the Causeway symbolizes the city's drive for modernization, transforming the old mud flats into a showcase of progress. This development, while physically impressive, often came at the cost of older, more natural elements, leading to the disappearance of familiar landmarks and ways of life. The change from naval station to cannery, the rise of automobiles over horse-drawn carriages, and the re-landscaping of old cemeteries reflect a pervasive modernization.
