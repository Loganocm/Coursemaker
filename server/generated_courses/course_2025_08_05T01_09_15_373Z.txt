# The Book of Small: An Exploration of Emily Carr's Childhood Victoria

## Module 1: Sunday

### notes - This module delves into the strict and predictable Sunday routine of Emily Carr's childhood home. It outlines the ritualistic Saturday evening bath, the solemn Sunday morning Presbyterian church service, and the subsequent cold mutton dinner. Father's stern adherence to routine, including a demanding sermon recall session, is contrasted with Mother's gentler approach. The module describes the family's walk to church, passing the 'Orphans' and the 'Park Hotel' (a source of Father's lasting dismay). Sunday school, hymns, and a family walk through their English-styled property are also covered, revealing Small's observations and occasional frustrations with the day's rigid structure, culminating in the evening Bible reading and a coveted candy treat.

### flashcards
Q: Describe the typical Sunday morning church experience for the Carr children.
A: The children attended Dr. Reid's Presbyterian Church. They wore starched, uncomfortable clothes and often fell asleep due to the stove's heat. Father, being slightly deaf, chose this church because he could hear the sermons from the top.

Q: What was 'The Park Hotel' and why was it a source of upset for Father?
A: The Park Hotel was originally a corner acre of Father's land, sold to Mrs. Lush under the promise no public house would be built. She broke her word, establishing a saloon that became a frequent destination for noisy sailors and ladies, hurting Father's sense of propriety.

A) Alice in Wonderland
B) The Peep of Day
C) Robinson Crusoe
D) Grimm's Fairy Tales

## Module 2: The Cow Yard

### notes - This module explores the Cow Yard as a vibrant, central space in Small's childhood, teeming with animal life and seasonal events. It introduces the Cow as a gentle, maternal figure, and Bong, the Chinaboy, who sings to her. The yard is a place of bonfires, roasted potatoes, and imaginative play, where Small contemplates her future and challenges Bigger's missionary aspirations. A significant element is the 'Killing Tree,' an ivy-covered tree that evokes fear and mystery in Small, symbolizing her early encounters with death and the unknown. The module concludes with Small's adventurous attempt to ride the Cow, resulting in a tumble, and the eventual arrival of a horse, though the space remains affectionately 'the Cow Yard.'

### flashcards
Q: What seasonal event was celebrated with a bonfire in the Cow Yard?
A: The bonfire was made from winter's accumulation of orchard prunings, branches, old boxes, and spring-cleaning discards, marking the arrival of Spring.

Q: Why did Small call a particular tree 'The Killing Tree'?
A: She called it 'The Killing Tree' because she heard her father say the ivy had killed it, and she later found a dead sparrow under it, associating the mysterious, ivy-dense space with death.

### quiz

A) Read a book
B) Sang a Chinese song in a falsetto voice
C) Ate his breakfast
D) Polished the milking pail
CORRECT: B

## Module 3: The Bishop and the Canary

### notes - This short module captures Small's intense joy and pride upon acquiring her first living pet, a yellow canary with a topknot. Overwhelmed with a sense of ownership and responsibility, she metaphorically declares, 'I shall be his God.' Eager to share her happiness, she encounters the revered Bishop, whom she holds in great awe. Despite her courage in approaching him, the Bishop's distant and vague response – a polite but impersonal comment on her being a 'pretty picture' – profoundly disappoints Small. His inability to truly see and appreciate her prized possession leaves her feeling hurt and her initial joyous wonder diminished, highlighting the disconnect between her inner world and the adult world's perceptions.

### flashcards
Q: What characteristic of the canary made Small choose it?
A: Small chose the canary with the topknot.

Q: How did the Bishop's reaction differ from what Small expected?
A: Small expected the Bishop to appreciate her bird, but he vaguely commented, 'Ah, child, you are a pretty picture,' and gently moved her aside, not truly seeing the bird.

### quiz
Q: What did Small whisper when she chose her canary?
A) He is beautiful!
B) Mine! I shall be his God.
C) I will name him Goldie.
D) He will sing for me.
CORRECT: B

## Module 4: The Blessing

### notes - This module illustrates the duality of religious experience in Small's childhood, contrasting Father's stern Presbyterianism with Mother's gentle Anglicanism. The Sunday morning Presbyterian service is depicted as a physically and emotionally arduous duty, yet tempered by a sense of 'rightness.' In contrast, the Sunday evening Anglican service is a cherished 'privilege,' despite the less pleasant smells of the nearby mud flats. The Anglican Bishop is portrayed as a gentle, ethereal figure whose voice and appearance are almost otherworldly. His 'Blessing' is the highlight of the service, eagerly anticipated by the children, making the experience meaningful and comforting, and providing a stark contrast to the formality and discomfort of the morning service.

### flashcards
Q: What was the main difference between the Sunday morning and Sunday evening church services?
A: Sunday morning was a long, strict Presbyterian service with Father. Sunday evening was a shorter, gentler Anglican service with Mother, considered a 'privilege.'

Q: How was the Anglican Bishop described?
A: The Anglican Bishop was described as mellow, gentle, wide, with a round face, white hair, blue eyes, and a voice as gentle as if it came from the moon, characterized by wheezy gasps.

### quiz
Q: Where was the Anglican church located in relation to the Carr house?
A) At the corner of Pandora and Blanshard streets
B) Just a little walk down over Marvin’s Hill to James’ Bay mud flats

CORRECT: B

## Module 5: Singing

### notes - This module focuses on Small's uninhibited, joyful singing, which her family, particularly Bigger and the Elder, deemed a 'horrible row' and 'scandalous.' Small, however, finds her true audience in the cow-yard creatures, who appreciate her 'cow-songs.' The narrative explores Small's defiance against her sisters' attempts to suppress her 'boiling over' voice. A significant turning point occurs when Small overhears her seemingly reserved mother and Mrs. Gregory sing 'old songs' with unexpected joy and liberation. This revelation shatters Small's assumption that adult 'Mother-ladies' stopped singing once their nurseries were empty, showing her that even grown-ups could express unbridled emotion, solidifying her own belief in joyful, uncontained song.

### flashcards
Q: Who was Small's most appreciative audience for her singing?
A: The cow and other animals in the cow-yard were Small's most appreciative audience.

Q: What surprising event did Small witness involving her mother and Mrs. Gregory?

A) Turned away bored
B) Stared at her angrily
C) Threw back her great ears and chewed harder, twiddling her ears
D) Ran away from the noise
CORRECT: C

## Module 6: The Praying Chair

### notes - This module centers on Small's deep desire for a dog, a wish she tries to fulfill by enlisting the help of Father's creaky 'praying chair' and the cat, Tibby. Small believes that because Father uses the chair for prayers, it holds a special connection to God. Her attempts to 'pray' for a puppy, however, are comically misinterpreted by her mother, leading to frustration. On her birthday, Small is bitterly disappointed to receive only a picture of a dog, confirming her cynical thought, 'God's deaf.' Years later, as an adult, Small finally acquires many dogs, raising Bobtail Sheepdogs. The 'praying chair' finds a new, meaningful home in her kennel nursery, symbolizing the eventual fulfillment of her childhood longing and a gentle, 'Amen' whisper of contentment.

### flashcards
Q: What was the significance of Father's wicker 'praying chair'?
A: The 'praying chair' was where Father sat to read family prayers every morning, and Small believed its 'splendid Amen' made it a good conduit for prayer.

Q: How did Small react to her birthday present of a dog picture?
A: Small was deeply disappointed, feeling 'drowning gladness' and stating, 'God's deaf,' as her wish for a real puppy went unfulfilled.

### quiz
Q: What did Small find on her plate for her birthday present?
A) A small puppy
B) A toy dog
C) A flat parcel containing a picture of a little girl holding a dog
D) A new hair-brush
CORRECT: C

## Module 7: Mrs. Crane

### notes - This module recounts Small's stay at Mrs. Crane's house due to Mother's illness, immediately introducing the disparity between what Small hears ('large heart') and what she perceives. Mrs. Crane is depicted as a stern, cold, and rigid figure who contrasts sharply with Small's own uninhibited nature. The Cranes' household reflects a different set of values, including animal cruelty (Mr. Crane's hunting dogs and Helen's mongrel). Small's observations, her frustration with rules, and her defiant acts (like tipping her chair or giving a hen castor oil) highlight the clash between her desire for warmth and freedom versus Mrs. Crane's strict, formal environment. Despite her dislike, Small ultimately glimpses a human vulnerability in Mrs. Crane, hinting at a more complex understanding.

### flashcards
Q: What was Small's first impression of Mrs. Crane's heart, and how did it contrast with her later observations?
A: Small initially heard Mrs. Crane had a 'large heart,' but later observed her as narrow and rigid, concluding her heart 'certainly could not be a wide one.'

Q: What particular incident showcased Small's defiance and led to trouble at Mrs. Crane's?
A: Small and Helen gave castor oil to a sick hen, leading to the hen flying around the nursery, knocking things over, and spitting oil on Mrs. Crane’s books, resulting in Mrs. Crane's anger and Small's shame.

### quiz
Q: What kind of animal was Cricket, and how was he treated differently from the other dogs?
A) A hunting dog, kept chained.
B) A cat, allowed indoors.
C) A pinto pony, used for rides and allowed to be handled by children.

CORRECT: C

## Module 8: White Currants

### notes - This module beautifully captures a moment of pure childhood imagination and sensory immersion in a specific, wild corner of the garden. Small is drawn to the white currant bush and the 'mauvy-pink' Rocket flowers, whose intense smell and vibrant life create a transformative experience. In this 'finished' part of the garden, where rubbish is dumped, Small enters a dreamlike state, imagining herself flying on white horses with an unseen boy. The elements of the scene—butterflies, flowers, hum, smell—merge into a single, splendid secret, mirroring the clarity of the ripening white currants. This magical experience is abruptly shattered by a grown-up's call, pulling Small back to reality and symbolizing the fleeting nature of such profound imaginative escapism.

### flashcards
Q: What made the white currants special compared to the black and red ones?
A: The white currants ripened first, and as they ripened, they grew clearer, allowing Small to almost see through them to their tiny veins, seeds, and juice.

Q: What was the 'most beautiful thing' that happened to Small in that garden corner?
A: Small experienced a magical, dreamlike state where she imagined flying on white horses with an unseen boy, with all the garden elements merging into 'one most lovely thing,' a splendid secret about to be revealed.

### quiz
Q: What did the grown-up voice call out that broke Small's magical experience?
A) Time for dinner!
B) Come and gather the white currants!
C) Don't play in the rubbish!
D) It's time for bed!
CORRECT: B

## Module 9: The Orange Lily

### notes - This module explores Small's encounter with Henry and Anne Mitchell, English nurserymen, and her contrasting perceptions of life and death. Small is immediately captivated by a vibrant, alive Orange Lily, whose grand petals and powerful perfume draw her in, representing pure, living beauty. In contrast, Anne Mitchell, a homesick woman, proudly displays her 'everlasting flowers,' brittle, dried specimens used for wreaths, symbolizing permanence and death. Small's preference for the living lily, despite its 'rusting' her nose with pollen, highlights her innate connection to the vibrant, ephemeral aspects of nature over the preserved. Anne's gentle persistence and Small's eventual acceptance of the gathered pinks underscore a subtle negotiation between their differing worldviews.

### flashcards
Q: What unique qualities of the Orange Lily attracted Small?
A: The Orange Lily had cool, slippery, alive petals, rolled grandly wide, with rust-powdered stamens guarding an 'empty' trumpet, captivating Small with its powerful perfume and vibrant presence.

Q: What did Anne Mitchell prefer to show Small instead of the Orange Lily, and what did these represent?
A: Anne preferred to show Small her 'everlasting flowers,' dried specimens used for wreaths, which represented permanence, absence of death, and perhaps her own longing for what endures.

### quiz
Q: What did Small use to wipe the lily's petals after touching them?
A) A damp cloth
B) Her pocket-handkerchief
C) Her pinafore
D) A leaf
CORRECT: B

## Module 10: How Lizzie was Shamed Right Through

### notes - This module vividly recounts Small's first party experience from the dual perspective of her four-year-old self and her eight-year-old sister, Lizzie. Small's uninhibited, natural childish behavior—dirtying her gloves, using informal language ('busted'), stuffing cake, and openly crying when disappointed—constantly mortifies Lizzie, who is acutely aware of societal expectations for politeness and cleanliness. The narrative highlights the painful contrast between Small's joyous, spontaneous actions and Lizzie's efforts to maintain decorum and avoid shame. Despite Lizzie's attempts to control her, Small's authentic reactions dominate the experience, emphasizing the innocent, messy reality of childhood against the backdrop of Victorian social conventions.

### flashcards
Q: What actions of Small at the party caused Lizzie to feel 'shamed right through'?
A: Small's dirty gloves, saying 'busted' instead of 'bursted,' stuffing currant cake into her cheeks, wearing a bib, needing to be washed, and howling over a lost prize all shamed Lizzie.

Q: How did Lizzie try to control Small's behavior?
A: Lizzie squealed at Small, whispered to Alice about Small's 'bad' behavior, and threatened to tell Mother about Small's actions like grabbing jelly cake with her mouth full.

B) Mr. Russell's hansom-cab
C) Mr. Winter's picnic carriage

## Module 11: British Columbia Nightingale

### notes - This module captures Small's intense childhood fear and curiosity sparked by a mysterious, loud, grating sound emanating from Beacon Hill Park at dusk. While her older sisters dismiss it as 'Spring noises,' Small imagines it as an enormous, terrifying monster, comparing its volume to pianos and cannons. Her fear leads her to contemplate never entering the park again. The tension resolves when Mother gently reveals the 'British Columbia Nightingale' is merely a joke for the myriad of little green frogs in the skunk-cabbage swamp. This simple explanation transforms Small's monstrous fear into affectionate understanding, highlighting the power of imagination and the comfort of truth.

### flashcards

## Module 12: Time

### notes - This module explores the subjective nature of time through Small's experience during a family picnic at Mill Stream. Father, in a rare moment of spontaneity, proposes the outing, leading to eager anticipation that makes the clock seem to crawl. Once at the stream, a place of vibrant natural detail—babbling water, diverse mosses, fragrant pines—the children immerse themselves in play, making the hours fly by. The abrupt call to return home challenges Small's perception, making her question 'what was Time anyway.' She concludes that places like the stream can condense hours into minutes, while clocks can stretch a week into a year, highlighting the profound difference between childhood immersion and adult adherence to schedules.

### flashcards
Q: How did the children's perception of time differ from the adults' during the picnic?
A: For the children, the time before the picnic seemed to drag, but the hours spent playing at the stream passed incredibly quickly, making them feel like they 'had only just come' when it was time to leave.

It begins with Father's extensive travels and his eventual choice of Victoria, a 'Crown Colony' with a strong English character, despite a brief return to England. The narrative emphasizes Father's internal conflict between loyalty to the 'Old Land' and his growing affection for the 'New.' The family's ten-acre property, part of Beckley Farm, is described as 'extremely English' with its hawthorn hedges and primrose banks, reflecting Father's transplanted homesickness. However, a 'new field' is left Canadian, symbolizing the family's gradual assimilation. The module highlights the pioneering spirit, Mother's initial loneliness, and the delicate beauty of the wild Canadian lilies in their 'new field.'

### flashcards

Beacon Hill Park is highlighted as a significant landmark, offering panoramic views that confirmed the 'world was round.' Dallas Road is presented as Victoria's first pleasure drive, characterized by its winding path, wind-sculpted trees, wild roses, and unique historical markers like sailors' graves and cannons guarding Esquimalt Harbour.

## Module 15: Silence and Pioneers

### notes - This module delves into the profound silence of the Western Canadian forests and the arduous life of the pioneers. The forests are described as silent, home to birds of prey, and resistant to human sound. It recounts occasional family drives to visit settlers carving homes out of the 'rebellious, untutored land,' fueled by the desire for a better future for their children. The pioneers' intense joy in creating from nothing, contrasted with their children's presumed inability to understand this unique satisfaction, is a central theme. The module also features vivid 'still-fresh-yesterday' stories from old Victorians who lived in Fort Camosun, including tales of navigating dangerous trails and the extraordinary arrival of the first piano in the colony, highlighting the raw, exciting experiences of early settlement.

### flashcards

## Module 16: Saloons and Roadhouses

### notes - This module provides a glimpse into the pervasive presence of saloons in early Victoria, both in the town center and as 'road-houses' along driving routes. Small's forbidden curiosity about these establishments, with their swinging 'pinafore doors' that concealed their interiors, is a central theme. Her accidental entry into a saloon during a cattle stampede reveals a mundane interior of bottles, sawdust, and beer. Road-houses, though also bars, are described as more aesthetically pleasing with their flower-boxes and caged animals, highlighting a tension between the illicit and the picturesque. The anecdote about Benny the horse, who instinctively stopped at every road-house, further illustrates how deeply embedded these places were in the daily life of the time.

### flashcards
Q: What did Small observe about the saloons' swinging doors?
A: The doors were 'pinafore doors' made of slats that swung noiselessly and quickly, never allowing Small a glimpse inside, despite her intense curiosity.

## Module 17: Ways of Getting Round

### notes - This module details the limited and distinctly English modes of transportation in early Victoria. Roads were mostly dirt with plank sidewalks, shared by pedestrians and cows that preferred the planks over mud. Mobility relied on one's own legs or horses, with families owning chaises or men preferring high dog-carts, both characterized by their slow pace and rustic mechanics. Livery stables, pervasive and aromatic with horse manure, provided hire services. The chapter notes a turning point when Small, at twelve, experiences the faster pace of an American city, leading Victorians to acknowledge their town's 'sleepy' reputation. It highlights their cultural preference for durable, if slow-to-arrive, English goods over 'jerry-built' American ones, emphasizing Victoria's staunch British identity.

### flashcards

## Module 18: Father's Store

### notes - This module describes Victoria's slow, conservative development, likening it to a 'lying-down cow, chewing,' resistant to change and deeply loyal to its English roots. It then focuses on Father's wholesale import business on Wharf Street, detailing its deep, dark interior packed with piled cases and barrels. The chapter provides vivid descriptions of the store's 'yard' (a shed for 'empties' and cats), Father's office, and his meticulous, 'dozened' business practices. It also touches on interactions with Indigenous people trading for maggoty raisins and the presence of the Customs House, highlighting the unique blend of commerce, culture, and colonial life along Victoria's waterfront. Father's attachment to his cats, fed with fresh milk, adds a personal touch to the commercial setting.

### flashcards
Q: Describe the interior of Father's wholesale store.
A: The store was deep and dark, with cases, crates, and barrels piled high to the ceiling, forming narrow lanes. It ended in a 'yard' (shed) filled with 'empties' and cats.

Q: What was unique about the raisins Father sold to the Indians?
A: The raisins were 'maggoty,' but Father sold them to the Indians because 'Indians love raisins and don’t mind maggots at all,' highlighting a cultural difference in food acceptance.

### quiz
Q: Where was Father's store located in Victoria?
A) Government Street
B) Fort Street
C) Yates Street
D) Wharf Street
CORRECT: D

## Module 19: New Neighbours

### notes - This module captures the transformative period in James' Bay as urbanization encroaches upon the children's wild play spaces. Bishop Cridge's expansive 'wild field,' once a cherished playground for 'ladies' games where Small played the 'bad child' hidden from a 'ferocious wild beast' (the Bishop's gentle cow, Colie), is sold for development. The arrival of surveyors with their instruments, who intrude upon the children's imaginative 'parlour' and 'dining-room,' signifies the end of an era. The rapid construction of 'real houses' on their 'pretend ones' symbolizes the irreversible march of progress, as Mother's subsequent offers of tea to the new neighbors mark the blending of old inhabitants with the new urban landscape.

### flashcards
Q: What was the 'wild field' opposite the Carrs' gate originally used for?
A: It was Bishop Cridge's field, a wild place with trees, bushes, and fallen logs, serving as a 'grand place to play ladies' for Small and his daughters.

Q: What symbolized the end of the children's imaginative play in the field?
A: The arrival of surveyors with their instruments, tearing down fences, and wagons dumping lumber and bricks, which quickly led to 'real houses' replacing their 'pretend ones.'

### quiz
Q: What was the name of the Bishop's cow, mistakenly thought of as a 'ferocious wild beast' by Small?
A) Daisie
B) Brownie
C) Colie

## Module 20: Visiting Matrons

### notes - This module describes the elaborate social ritual of 'visiting' among Victorian matrons in Victoria. Due to transportation limitations and the reliance on Chinese help, visits were all-day family affairs, with children dispersing to explore gardens and eat fruit. The narrative contrasts the Carrs' 'prim' garden with their friends' 'rambling' one and details the distinct sensory journey—from wild rose perfumes to the dreadful smells of mud flats, Chinatown, gas-works, and a tannery—encountered when traveling between homes. It also outlines forms of Victorian entertainment, including family evening parties with charades and church 'conversaziones,' emphasizing the shift from informal, inclusive gatherings to more selective social groups as Victoria grew.

### flashcards
Q: Why did Victorian matrons bring their entire families on visits?
A: They brought their families because short calls were not customary, Chinese help couldn't be left in charge, and without a horse, walking meant taking everyone along for a full day.

Q: Describe the range of smells one would encounter traveling between the Carrs' home and their friends' house.
A: The journey included delicious wild rose perfume, the dreadful smell of mud flats, stuffy foreign smells of Chinatown, healthful but not nice gas-works, low-tide smells by the saw-mill, and the worst smell from the tannery.

### quiz
Q: What was a 'church conversazione'?
A) A solemn prayer meeting.
B) A social event held in the church school-room with cubicles for confidential conversations, music, and tea.

## Module 21: Servants

### notes - This module explores the crucial role of servants in Victorian Victoria, focusing on the common presence of 'green little Chinese boys' who arrived at age twelve without English. Their adaptation was slow; they remained culturally aloof, returning to Chinatown after work to be 'completely Chinese.' The narrative contrasts them with English servants, who grumbled but sought marriage and upward mobility. Bong, the Carrs' pock-marked Chinaboy, is described as homesick but comforted by the family cow, embodying this cultural detachment. The module also introduces Wash Mary, an Indigenous woman, whose 'more human and understandable' presence offers a different dynamic, highlighting the diverse, often segregated, labor force that supported Victorian households.

### flashcards
Q: What distinguished the 'green little Chinese boys' as servants in Victoria?
A: They arrived at age twelve without English, learned just enough Canadian ways to earn money, remained culturally aloof, and spent their off-hours entirely in Chinatown.

Q: How did Bong, the Carrs' Chinaboy, cope with homesickness?
A: When overwhelmed, Bong would cry, and Mother would comfort him. He also found great comfort in singing Chinese songs to the family cow, who seemed to understand and listen attentively.

### quiz
Q: What did Wash Mary use to bind her head?
A) A lace cap
B) A velvet ribbon
C) A black silk handkerchief
D) A straw hat
CORRECT: C

## Module 22: East and West

### notes - This module explores the contrasting roles and perceptions of Chinese immigrants and Indigenous peoples in early Victoria. The Chinaman is portrayed as a diligent, frugal worker—a peddler or market gardener—who toiled tirelessly to send money back to China, seen by white settlers as 'elusive' and difficult to understand. In contrast, the Indigenous man, often accompanied by his burden-carrying 'squaw,' is depicted as living leisurely, taking from nature what came easiest, spending money immediately, and seen by white settlers as 'childlike' and more comprehensible. The narrative highlights the divergent approaches to labor, land use, and money, emphasizing the white man's struggle to truly grasp the Oriental culture while feeling a degree of understanding for the Indigenous way of life.

### flashcards
Q: How did the Chinese and Indigenous people differ in their approach to money and labor?
A: The Chinese worked diligently and frugally, sending earnings home to China, while Indigenous people took from nature easily and spent money immediately, having no concept of its value or saving.

A) A canvas bag
B) A leather satchel
C) A cedar-root burden basket of her own weaving
D) A woven backpack

## Module 23: A Cup of Tea

### notes - This module narrates a moment of quiet, powerful cross-cultural compassion on a Victoria beach. An Indigenous family, on a canoe journey, sets up camp. The scene details their simple life: fire, cooking, and the woman's paddle-weary body. Their peaceful evening is interrupted by the sight of a lone Chinaman struggling with his clumsy fish-boat in high waves. Without hesitation or spoken words, the Indigenous man and woman launch their heavy canoe to rescue him, towing his boat ashore. The ensuing scene around the campfire, where the Indian woman offers the Chinaman tea, becomes a profound act of hospitality. The shared meal, marked by the Chinaman's genuine gratitude and the woman's simple 'Uh-huh!' and smile, transcends language barriers, illustrating a deep, human connection.

### flashcards

## Module 24: Cathedral

### notes - This module describes Christ Church Cathedral, positioned atop Church Hill, as a central symbol of Victoria's British and national identity. Although the initial wooden structure burned, the rebuilt one, repeatedly expanded, became an emblem of 'National Faith' for all Britons, regardless of denomination. The narrative contrasts its grandeur with the more humble Reformed Episcopal Church, where Mother worshipped, highlighting the lingering 'High' and 'Low' church controversy.

## Module 25: Cemetery

### notes - This module explores the cemeteries of Victorian Victoria, beginning with the small, overgrown Quadra Street cemetery, a wild place with intertwined brambles and flowers. It notes the unique practice of the Chinese, who used a large stone altar for offerings and whose graves were temporary, with bones destined for China. This contrasts with the larger, more organized Ross Bay Cemetery, which, despite its tidiness, maintained social divisions with separate sections for different religious denominations and paupers. The module vividly describes the slow, dignified Victorian funeral processions, with their specific hearses and mourners, and the relentless waves of Ross Bay, symbolizing nature's eventual triumph over human distinctions and order.

### flashcards

## Module 26: Schools

### notes - This module details the English settlers' initial disdain for Canadian public schools, preferring 'ultra-genteel' Ladies' Academies that emphasized manners and discouraged 'Colonial deportment.' The Carr family's children experienced this shift: older daughters attended a deportment academy, while the younger ones, including Small, went to public school, a decision Father made for practical education, despite criticism. Small's early school years at Mrs. Fraser's are highlighted, where she found comfort on the 'dunce stool' and cherished Grimm's Fairy Tales, revealing her unique spirit and disinterest in formal politeness. The eventual acceptance of public schools for vocational reasons underscores the changing societal priorities and the gradual shaping of a Canadian identity.

### flashcards

Preparations include sewing gifts, making plum puddings, and decorating the house with fresh fir and holly. Christmas Eve brings a magical trip to town to see shop windows adorned with mock snow and festive displays, contrasting the appealing food shops (like Mr. Saunders' with a real Santa grinding coffee) with Goodacre's gruesome butcher shop, displaying naked, carved carcasses. The module also touches on family church attendance on Christmas morning and the cultural distance of Bong, the Chinese servant, from the family's celebrations, highlighting the blend of domestic warmth, commercial spectacle, and cultural particularities.

## Module 28: Regatta

### notes - This module describes the lively annual Regatta held on Victoria's Gorge waters, a major public attraction. It features thrilling races between the British Navy's bluejackets in their heavy ships' boats and Indigenous tribes in their slender, fast dugout canoes, vividly contrasting their styles and power. The narrative highlights the festive atmosphere of the harbour, filled with flags, music, and onlookers. However, the module also exposes a darker, cruel aspect of the entertainment: a greased pole competition where men tried to dislodge a crate containing an 'agonized pig,' whose squeals were met with laughter. This brutal event contrasts sharply with the earlier descriptions of athletic prowess, revealing a less humane side of public spectacle and Small's developing sensitivity.

### flashcards

## Module 29: Characters

### notes - This module introduces the diverse and often eccentric 'strange characters' who populated Victoria, many of whom were British transplants unable to fit elsewhere. These included 'glued-together' bachelor siblings and spinster aunts, who struggled to adapt to colonial life, often becoming 'wilted, homesick derelicts.' The narrative vividly describes local figures like the O'Flahty siblings, who built a bizarre driftwood shanty; Elizabeth Pickering, an intoxicated woman in a red shawl; and old Teenie, a half-negro, half-crazy scavenger. The module also mentions doddering old gentlemen with nursemaid horses and a 'Papa's-sister' Aunt who tirelessly but unsuccessfully tried to impose English manners on young Canadians, collectively illustrating the peculiar social tapestry of early Victoria.

### flashcards

## Module 30: Loyalty

### notes - This module explores Victoria's profound loyalty to the British Crown, particularly Queen Victoria, whose birthday was a major celebration. Small's abstract understanding of royalty is made real through Mrs. Mitchell, a homesick English nurseryman's wife, who personifies the Royal Family through newspaper clippings and her deep grief over her guinea fowl (treated like children). Mrs. Mitchell's vivid stories and emotional connection, especially to the late Princess Alice, bring the distant monarchy to life for Small. The visit of Princess Louise and the Marquis of Lorne further intensifies Mrs. Mitchell's homesickness, leading her to return to an England that, too, has changed.

## Module 31: Doctor and Dentist

### notes - This module contrasts the two principal medical figures in Victorian Victoria: the revered Dr. Helmcken and the detested dentist. Dr. Helmcken, the 'Family Doctor,' is portrayed as thin, active, and cheerful, a resourceful frontier doctor who handles all ailments, performs minor surgeries (like stitching Small's brother's leg), and even puts out fires. He is a symbol of trust and competence. In contrast, the dentist is depicted as a 'shamming' and painful figure, whose deceptive assurances lead to brutal extractions, fostering Small's deep dislike and her private nickname for him, 'Royal Beast.' The module vividly illustrates the raw, often painful, medical practices of the era and Small's strong, visceral reactions to perceived dishonesty and physical discomfort.

### flashcards
Q: Describe Dr. Helmcken's character and his medical practices.

## Module 32: Chain Gang

### notes - This module describes Small's unsettling encounter with the Chain Gang, men with shaved heads and iron bars on their legs, crushing rocks under armed guard near the Parliament Buildings. Small's sister's secretive 'hush-frown' emphasizes the forbidden nature of discussing these convicts. The narrative then introduces 'Lizzie,' a rock-chewing machine that eventually replaces the Chain Gang's arduous labor. The module also details the topography of Marvin's Hill and Church Hill, the James' Bay mud flats (which became the town's rubbish dump, scavenged by Indigenous people), and the high sidewalk that offered views of Kanaka Row and the Convent garden, illustrating Victoria's changing social and infrastructural landscape.

### flashcards

## Module 33: Cook Street

### notes - This module charts the transformation of Cook Street from a semi-residential area to a 'skunk-cabbage bog' and eventually a formalized highway. Initially, the unmade southern end served as Victoria's primary garbage dump, with horse-drawn carts spilling refuse into the bog. This accumulated rubbish slowly formed the street's foundation, creating a chaotic landscape through which Small loved to ride her pony, observing wild roses growing through discarded stoves. The module also features Teenie, a half-crazy, half-negro scavenger, who rooted through the debris. Later, Cook Street became home to Chinese vegetable gardens, emphasizing their laborious, hand-watering methods, before finally evolving into a paved, residential highway with modern waste disposal.

### flashcards
Q: How was Cook Street initially formed as a road?
A: It was built up and solidified over years by the dumping and compaction of city garbage, with horses' hooves and children's boots helping to pound the rubbish to solidity.

Q: Describe the Chinese vegetable gardens along Cook Street.
A: Patient, blue-jean clad Chinamen worked from dawn till dark, hand-watering plants from wells using five-gallon coal oil cans on bamboo poles, and later carried vegetables door-to-door in bamboo baskets.

### quiz

## Module 34: Waterworks

### notes - This module chronicles Victoria's journey towards modern infrastructure, specifically water supply and sanitation. It details the transition from individual wells and water-cart deliveries to the momentous event of piped-in Beaver Lake water, which led to the creation of indoor bathrooms. However, this modernization was not without its challenges; the initial plumbing systems were poorly protected, leading to pipes freezing and bursting in cold winters, causing widespread grumbling. The module also describes other 'newfangled notions' like prohibiting cows from roaming streets, introducing dog taxes, and the transformation of small farms into public spaces like Caledonian Park, highlighting the rapid pace of urban development and its social impacts, including the arrival of a circus.

### flashcards
Q: What were the primary methods of water supply in Victoria before piped water?
A: People relied on individual wells (like the Carrs' deep kitchen well), rain barrels, and water purchased by the bucket from a large barrel water-cart.

Q: What major issue arose with the introduction of piped water in Victoria's early years?
A: During cold winters, the unprotected pipes, especially in bathrooms built on north sides of houses, would freeze solid and burst, leading to widespread discontent with 'modern plumbing.'

### quiz
Q: What large event came to Caledonian Park just before its lease expired?
A) A grand fair
B) A political rally
C) A Barnum and Bailey Circus
D) A sports championship
CORRECT: C

## Module 35: From Carr Street to James' Bay

### notes - This module describes Small's expanding world as she gains permission to walk further into town with her Father. The narrative provides a richly detailed tour of the neighborhood, introducing a vibrant cast of characters and their distinctive homes along Carr Street, Toronto Street, and Princess Avenue. Small keenly observes local figures like the Fawcetts, Mrs. McConnell (a busy, shouting farm lady), Uncle Jack, Mrs. Swannick (the 'no nose' lady), Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Lipsett (the 'skinny' brusher), Mrs. Cameron, and Mrs. Plummer ('Mrs. Plum'). The module includes a poignant memory of Mrs. McConnell's baby's funeral, a formative experience for Small. It highlights her growing social awareness, her defiance towards her sister, and her eventual attendance at Mrs. Fraser's local school, allowing her to retain cherished neighborhood connections.

### flashcards
Q: What unique features characterized Mrs. Plummer's cottage?
A: Her cottage was made of corrugated iron with a verandah, and every window was a glass door extending to the floor, allowing her to 'rush straight out of any room into her garden.'

Q: How did Small react to Mrs. McConnell's baby's funeral?
A: Small was deeply affected by the cold, funny appearance of the baby and, despite her mother's explanation of death, she only 'half understood' and avoided the short cut through Mrs. McConnell's farm for a long time.

### quiz
Q: What was a distinguishing feature of the Fawcetts' children's clothes?
A) They were always too small.
B) They were always too big because their mother knew they would grow.

## Module 36: Grown Up

### notes - This module explores Victoria's dramatic transformation from a 'lying-down cow' to a modern city, marked by its rivalry with Vancouver and the catalytic influence of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). It details major infrastructure projects—the magnificent stone Parliament Buildings, the opulent Empress Hotel, and the concrete causeway replacing the old James' Bay Bridge—which symbolized this modernization but also displaced old landmarks and ways of life. The Gorge, once a beauty spot, became industrialized. The module concludes with Victoria's evolving identity: while losing some 'Old Country' traits and resisting rapid 'boom and bustle,' it settles into a 'slow easy development,' retaining its tranquil charm and natural beauty, embracing its 'Western' identity.

### flashcards
Q: How did the building of the concrete causeway impact James' Bay?
A: The causeway dammed the Bay waters, caused the old mud-flat smells to intensify initially, led to the demise of Pendray's soap works and Kanaka Row, and transformed the area into solid ground for new development like the Empress Hotel.

Q: What happened to the Driard Hotel after the Empress Hotel was built?
A: The Driard Hotel 'withered entirely away' as visitors preferred the Empress's modern luxury and harbor views over its stuffiness and limited outlook.

### quiz
