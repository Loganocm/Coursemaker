## Course Content

### Notes

The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) is dedicated to training global, ethical leaders by focusing on academic and leadership development. It stands as one of the nation's six senior military colleges, uniquely positioned within a larger public university (alongside Texas A&M).

**Program Distinction:**
*   **Corps vs. ROTC:** While ROTC programs at Virginia Tech are federal and part of their respective military services, the Corps is an integral part of the state university. University policy mandates that students enrolled in ROTC must also be in the Corps, though Corps cadets are not required to join ROTC.
*   **Two Tracks:** Cadets can pursue a Military-Leader Track (preparing for commissioning into military services) or a Citizen-Leader Track (applying Corps experiences to private and public sector careers). Cadets have the flexibility to shift between these tracks based on their evolving career goals.

**Corps Organization & Communication:**
*   **Leadership Structure:** Deputy Commandants work under the Commandant of Cadets, each overseeing one of the four cadet battalions.
*   **Family Contact:** The cadet’s deputy commandant serves as the most direct point of contact for families, acting as an advisor, mentor, counselor, supervisor, and disciplinarian. Email is the preferred method of communication.
*   **Confidentiality:** Deputy Commandants are bound by the Federal Privacy Act (FERPA) and university policies, meaning they cannot disclose grades or health information without the cadet’s explicit consent, nor can they compel a cadet to attend class.
*   **High Standards:** Cadets are held to a higher standard of performance and conduct than other Virginia Tech students, fostering respect and discipline. Family support in reinforcing these standards is highly valued.

**Academic Success:**
*   **Three Legs of Development:** The Corps' leader development program is built upon academics, leadership experiences, and physical fitness.
*   **Evening Call-to-Quarters (ECQ):** Dedicated study time in residence halls from 6 to 11 p.m. on Sundays and 7 to 11 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays. Quiet hours are strictly enforced, but cadets can sign out for off-site study or group meetings.
*   **Academic Resources:** Cadets have access to university-wide resources like the Student Success Center, the Writing Center, and Career and Professional Development.
*   **Rice Center for Leader Development:** This center integrates coursework, real-world leadership experiences, ethics education, and guest speakers into the cadet's development.
*   **New Cadet Academics:** First-year cadets are enrolled in an accredited leader development course that includes a Corps class and a two-hour weekly session focused on college transition skills (e.g., reading, note-taking, time management).
*   **Corps Leadership Minor:** Cadets can pursue this minor, which includes Corps and ROTC/Citizen-Leader Track courses, business/ethics courses, and at least three approved leadership roles.
*   **Honors College:** The Corps collaborates with the Virginia Tech Honors College, allowing eligible cadets (GPA 3.6+) to apply and fulfill Honors College requirements through Corps activities.

**Leadership Experiences:**
*   **Progressive Development:** The four-year program follows a servant-leader model, building leadership skills progressively:
    *   **First-year:** Leading self, preparing for fire team leader.
    *   **Sophomore year:** Leading people, preparing for cadet NCO.
    *   **Junior year:** Leading organizations, preparing for cadet officer.
    *   **Senior year:** Leading for the future, preparing for junior officer or citizen-leader.
*   **Conferences & Global Opportunities:** Cadets can attend national leadership conferences and participate in Virginia Tech's study abroad programs. The Corps also administers specific programs like the Global Scholars Program (focused on national security and global competency with overseas battlefield trips) and the Olmsted Foundation Undergraduate Scholars program (for cultural understanding). Project Global Officer (Project GO) is a fully funded DoD initiative to improve language and cultural skills for future officers.
*   **Guest Speakers:** The Cutchins Leadership Lecture Series features notable speakers on leadership, ethics, and Medal of Honor recipients. Leaders in Contact panels provide insights from Corps alumni.

**Scholarships:**
*   **Emerging Leader Scholarships (ELS):** Exclusive to cadets, requiring physical fitness standards and a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA from junior year onward. Subject to suspension or loss due to disciplinary action or early departure.
*   **Commandant’s Scholarships:** Available after the first year, with preference often given to Citizen-Leader Track cadets or those without ROTC scholarships.
*   **Other Opportunities:** Include the Major General and Mrs. Randy Fullhart Horizon Fund and the Commandant’s Response Scholarship Fund for financial crises.
*   **FAFSA:** Required annually for all scholarship recipients, regardless of other financial aid.

**Wellness: Physical and Mental Health:**
*   **Physical Fitness:** All cadets participate in routines. ROTC cadets must meet specific standards; Citizen-Leader Track cadets must meet standards by their junior year. Facilities include an obstacle course, rappel tower, and workout areas.
*   **Health & Nutrition:** Virginia Tech's Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise offers free one-on-one sessions.
*   **Schiffert Health Center:** On-campus healthcare covered by the student health fee, including unlimited visits and most lab procedures.
*   **Cook Counseling Center:** Provides confidential mental health services for students (stress, anxiety, depression). Parents can contact the center with concerns, but counselors cannot disclose student information without written consent.
*   **Parental Contact:** Families are also encouraged to reach out to their cadet’s deputy commandant or senior enlisted advisor with concerns.

**The Whole Person:**
*   **Student Affairs:** The Corps is part of Virginia Tech Student Affairs, which fosters students' development as successful, educated, and reflective individuals.
*   **Aspirations for Student Learning:** Emphasizes curiosity, self-understanding and integrity, civility, courageous leadership, and "Ut Prosim" (service to others).
*   **CliftonStrengths®:** An assessment tool to help students identify and develop their natural talents and strengths.
*   **Inclusive VT:** Promotes a dynamic and inclusive community that values diversity, practices Principles of Community, and supports the belonging and well-being of all members.

**Protocols & Standards:**
*   **Honor System:** Cadets adhere to the Honor Code: "A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do." Violations are adjudicated by the Cadet Honor Court.
*   **Hazing Policy:** Hazing is a criminal offense in Virginia and strictly prohibited by the university and Corps. Alleged violations are reported to university authorities and potentially police, leading to severe sanctions including suspension or dismissal from the Corps.
*   **Mutual Respect and Safety:** Harassment and assaults are not tolerated, with consequences ranging from Corps policies (Cadet Regulations) to criminal sanctions.
*   **Alcohol Policy:** Alcohol abuse and possession of false identification are major disciplinary issues. The Corps policy is more immediate and severe than general university policy. Underage consumption, irresponsible consumption by legal-age cadets, and false IDs are not tolerated (false ID is an Honor Code violation). First offenses can lead to military probation and scholarship loss; second and third offenses can result in suspension or dismissal. Assisting underage cadets in acquiring alcohol can lead to dismissal. ROTC units are informed of all alcohol incidents, which can affect commissioning suitability and scholarship eligibility.
*   **Acknowledgment of Understanding:** Cadets sign an acknowledgment of alcohol, hazing, and sexual harassment/assault policies, which is maintained in their record.
*   **Withdrawal Policy:** First-semester cadets leaving the Corps before October 4, 2024, must also withdraw from the university for the fall semester but can return as civilian students in the spring. Upper-class and second-semester first-year cadets can request a change to civilian status at any time, with housing considerations.

**Leaving Campus (Passes and Leave):**
*   **Pass vs. Leave:** "Pass" allows travel within 50 miles, while "leave" is for travel beyond 50 miles.
*   **Closed Weekends:** Mandatory events where overnight leave is typically not approved until after scheduled activities, with exceptions for major family events, emergencies, medical appointments, or academic commitments.
*   **Regular Pass:** First-year cadets may receive passes (usually Friday evenings, expiring at midnight), approved by their chain of command.
*   **Regular Leave:** Approved by the cadet’s deputy commandant for open weekends.
*   **Family Pass:** First-year cadets can stay overnight with immediate family during visits (Friday/Saturday), but it typically does not excuse them from mandatory Corps functions on closed weekends.
*   **Holidays:** First-year cadets observe university holidays but may have limited leave opportunities before Thanksgiving due to training and closed weekends.
*   **Travel After Finals:** Cadets must depart within 24 hours of their last final.

**Key Events:**
*   **Parades and Formal Retreats:** Public ceremonies on campus, typically lasting 15 minutes for retreats and an hour for parades.
*   **Caldwell March:** A 26-mile capstone event for first-year cadets, completed in two 13-mile phases (fall and spring), honoring Addison Caldwell, the first Virginia Tech student.
*   **Home Football Games:** Cadets attend all home games, entering via a regimental march-on and sitting in designated Corps seating in the South End Zone.

**Family Resources:**
*   **Mail & Packages:** New cadets receive mail at a specific CLMS Bldg address during New Cadet Week, then through VT Mail Services afterward. Packages are picked up after email notification.
*   **Parking:** Visitors must pay for parking on campus Monday-Friday, 7 a.m.-10 p.m., with the North End Center parking garage available seven days a week.
