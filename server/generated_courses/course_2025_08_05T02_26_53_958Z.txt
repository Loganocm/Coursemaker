# Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Family Guide 2024-2025

## THE BASICS

### Notes

The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) is dedicated to developing global, ethical leaders, focusing on their academic and leadership success. Virginia Tech is one of six senior military colleges in the nation, and one of only two that features a corps of cadets integrated within a larger, public university (the other being Texas A&M).

**ROTC Programs vs. The Corps:**
*   **ROTC Programs:** These are federal programs, part of their respective military services. Questions concerning ROTC programs, medical issues, or commissioning should be directed to ROTC staff.
*   **The Corps:** This is a component of the state university itself.

**Enrollment Policy:** University policy mandates that students enrolled in an ROTC program must also be part of the Corps. However, a cadet can be a member of the Corps without being enrolled in an ROTC program.

**Cadet Tracks:** The Corps offers two distinct tracks, and cadets have the flexibility to switch between them if their career goals or circumstances evolve:
*   **Military-Leader Track:** This track is designed to prepare cadets for commissioning into one of the military services.
*   **Citizen-Leader Track:** This track allows cadets to apply their experiences gained within the Corps directly to careers in the private and public sectors.

**Corps Organization and Contact for Families:**
*   **Deputy Commandants (DCs):** These individuals report directly to the Commandant of Cadets. Each Deputy Commandant is responsible for the daily supervision of one of the four cadet battalions.
*   **Family Contact:** For family members, the most direct point of contact with the commandant’s staff is their cadet’s assigned Deputy Commandant. Email is the preferred method of communication.
*   **Role of Deputy Commandants:** DCs serve multiple roles, including advisor, mentor, counselor, supervisor, and disciplinarian.
*   **Confidentiality (FERPA):** As university officials, Deputy Commandants are bound by the Federal Privacy Act (FERPA) and university policies on student confidentiality. This means they cannot disclose a cadet's grades or health information without the cadet's explicit consent. They also lack the authority to compel a cadet to attend class. However, they are committed to working collaboratively with families and cadets to help balance the demands of the university, the Corps, and family life.

## WELCOME TO THE CORPS

### Notes

Joining the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is a significant commitment for young individuals, offering substantial rewards despite its challenges. This program facilitates the transition from high school to college, but within a unique military-like framework focused on leadership development. Cadets are expected to adhere to significantly higher standards of performance and conduct compared to other Virginia Tech students, a commitment that earns them respect. The Corps' mission is to cultivate leaders of the highest moral and ethical standards.

Families play an indispensable role as allies and partners in the cadet's journey. The commandant's staff acknowledges the deep family involvement and understands that part of the family 'goes to college' with the cadet. This guide is designed to address frequently asked questions from families and provide essential contact information within the Corps, ensuring support throughout the year. The Corps is dedicated to the ultimate success of every cadet, and family reinforcement of standards is crucial. There will likely be moments when cadets question their path, and the long-range perspective and unwavering support from family members are vital in helping them persevere and make choices that align with their full potential, rather than opting for an easier, less rewarding alternative.

## ACADEMIC SUCCESS

### Notes

The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) leader development program is built upon three fundamental pillars: academics, leadership experiences, and physical fitness.

**Academics**
Dedicated study time, known as **Evening Call-to-Quarters (ECQ)**, is a core component of the academic program. During ECQ, cadets have specific quiet hours for study in their residence halls. These hours are from **6 to 11 p.m. on Sundays** and **7 to 11 p.m. from Mondays through Thursdays**. Academics are the priority during these periods, with noise kept to a minimum. A cadet duty officer is responsible for enforcing these quiet hours. Cadets do have the flexibility to sign out during ECQ if they need to study in alternative locations, or meet with study groups or tutors.

**Resources Available for Academic Success**
Virginia Tech provides several free resources to support all students, aiding in their transition from high school to college and continuous improvement throughout their academic careers:
*   **The Student Success Center:** Offers comprehensive support to undergraduates through a variety of programs and services.
*   **The Writing Center (located in Newman Library):** Provides assistance with writing and reading assignments.
*   **Career and Professional Development:** Helps students explore various career options, find experiential learning opportunities and jobs, and plan for future graduate or professional schooling.

**The Corps’ Rice Center for Leader Development**
This center plays a pivotal role in transforming cadets into inspiring leaders. Its comprehensive program includes formal coursework, hands-on real-world leadership experiences, dedicated ethics education, informative lectures, and engaging guest speakers.

**New Cadet Leader Development Course**
First-year cadets are enrolled in an accredited leader development course during both semesters. This course includes a specific Corps class alongside a dedicated two-hour period on Thursdays. This Thursday session is specifically designed to facilitate the transition from high school to college, covering essential academic skills such as reading comprehension, effective note-taking, active listening, personal productivity strategies, and time management using a daily planner.

**Company S-5 (Academic) Staff**
New cadets also benefit from the guidance and motivation provided by their company's S-5 (academic) staff. These are successful, experienced cadets who exemplify the habits and mindset crucial for achieving academic success.

**The Corps Leadership Minor**
Cadets have the option to pursue a minor in leadership studies through the Corps. New cadets receive information on how to declare this minor during their fall semester. Supervised by the Rice Center, the minor requires:
*   Completion of Corps courses combined with either ROTC or Citizen-Leader Track courses.
*   Two business or ethics courses.
*   Participation in at least three approved leadership roles within the Corps or ROTC.

**Honors College**
The Corps actively collaborates with the Virginia Tech Honors College to support cadets in their pursuit of honors diplomas, scholarships, and other academic certifications. Any cadet maintaining a GPA of 3.6 or higher is eligible to apply to the Honors College. Notably, many activities undertaken within the Corps program can be utilized to fulfill Honors College requirements.

## LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCES

### Notes

The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) offers a comprehensive four-year progressive leader development program. This program is founded on a servant-leader model, emphasizing selflessness and respect for others.

**Leadership Progression by Year:**
*   **First-year:** Focuses on leading self, preparing cadets to become fire team leaders.
*   **Sophomore year:** Centers on leading people, preparing cadets for roles as cadet NCOs (Non-Commissioned Officers).
*   **Junior year:** Involves leading organizations, with preparation for becoming cadet officers.
*   **Senior year:** Concentrates on leading for the future, getting cadets ready to be junior officers or citizen-leaders.

Each academic year is structured with a 'learn-experience progression.' The fall semester is dedicated to learning new skills, while the spring semester focuses on putting these skills into practice and reflecting on the experiences.

**Leadership Conferences:**
Cadets have valuable opportunities to attend leadership conferences across the nation. Many of these events are sponsored by service academies and other senior military colleges. These conferences allow cadets to interact with peers from various military training institutions, as well as civilian students pursuing leadership training. This engagement enhances their leader development and enables them to bring best practices back to the Corps and apply them to their personal leadership styles.

**Global Experiences:**
VTCC cadets can take advantage of all study abroad opportunities offered by Virginia Tech. Additionally, the Corps administers its own unique global programs:

*   **VTCC Global Scholars Program:** This program focuses on leadership, national security, and global competency. It includes a three-credit hour seminar for selected cadets during the spring semester, followed by a weeklong trip to overseas battlefields in May. The trip is largely funded by alumni donations. The program's goal is 'applied history,' using lessons from World War I, World War II, and other conflicts to foster discussions about current global leadership and national security challenges.

*   **Olmsted Foundation Undergraduate Scholars Program:** Sponsored by The George and Carol Olmsted Foundation, this program aims to provide active-duty military officers, cadets, and midshipmen at senior military colleges with a deeper understanding of foreign cultures. A recent example of their travel was through the International Cultural Immersion Program in Panama.

*   **Project GO (Global Officer):** This is a Department of Defense initiative designed to improve the language skills and regional expertise of cadets.

*   **ROTC-specific Programs:** Cadets participating in ROTC can also access specific global opportunities tailored to their respective ROTC branches.

**1. Honor System:**
*   **Core Principle:** Cadets are taught the Cadet Honor Code, which states: "A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do."
*   **Violations:** Any violations of this code are serious and are adjudicated by the Cadet Honor Court, which determines appropriate sanctions.
*   **Family Role:** Families are encouraged to support their cadets in living honorably and avoiding potential honor violations.

**2. Policy on Hazing:**
*   **Legality:** Hazing is a criminal offense in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
*   **University & Corps Policy:** Both Virginia Tech and the Corps have a strict zero-tolerance policy against hazing, which is considered the antithesis of positive leadership.
*   **"Traditions":** Cadets must understand that activities presented as "traditions" by older alumni might be considered hazing and will be treated as such.
*   **Reporting:** Alleged violations are reported to the Virginia Tech Police, Office of Student Activities, or Student Conduct Office. Deputy commandants will also notify ROTC professors.
*   **Sanctions:** Hazing violations are adjudicated by a Deputy Commandant's Disciplinary Hearing. Sanctions, which are coordinated with the Student Conduct Office, can include suspension or dismissal from the Corps, in addition to any university or Commonwealth of Virginia penalties.

**3. Mutual Respect and Safety:**
*   **Expectations:** Cadets are required to consistently display proper behavior and respect for all individuals.
*   **Zero Tolerance:** Harassment and assaults of any kind are strictly forbidden and may lead to criminal sanctions.

**4. Alcohol Policy:**
*   **Major Disciplinary Cause:** Alcohol abuse and possession of false identification are the leading causes of disciplinary sanctions at Virginia Tech.

    *   Even a first offense can negatively impact a cadet's standing in an ROTC program and may lead to a formal evaluation of their suitability for commissioning.

**5. Acknowledgment of Understanding:**
*   **Requirement:** After being briefed on the alcohol, hazing, and sexual harassment/assault policies at the start of the school year, all cadets are required to sign an Acknowledgment of Understanding. This document is maintained in their cadet record.

**6. Withdrawal Policy:**
*   **First-Semester Cadets:** Any first-semester cadet (first-year or off-campus transfer) who wishes to leave the Corps before October 4, 2024, must also withdraw from the university for the remainder of the fall semester. They can return as a civilian student in the spring semester without re-applying.
*   **General Expectation:** Normally, cadets are expected to resign from the Corps and change to civilian status at the end of an academic semester.
*   **Upper-Class/Second-Semester First-Year Cadets:** These cadets may request a change to civilian status at any time, subject to regulations.
