## Module 1: Life on Sunday

### notes - This module explores the meticulous and unchanging Sunday routine in the Carr household, offering a window into Victorian family life and religious observance. From Saturday night baths using brown Windsor soap and the meticulous storage of toys, to Father's camphor-scented presence and the children's uncomfortable church attire, every detail reinforces the day's solemnity. The narrative highlights the contrast between Father's strict Presbyterianism and Mother's gentler Anglicanism, influencing the children's dual religious experiences. Key moments include the walk to Dr. Reid's church, the formal cold mutton dinner followed by sermon recollection, and the highly structured Sunday School.

Small's imaginative world often intertwines with the animals, reflecting her deep connection to them, such as her desire for the Cow to have a colt. The module also introduces a darker element: 'The Killing Tree,' an ivy-covered tree that evokes fear and mystery for Small, associated with silence and death. This contrasts with the joyous new life in the yard, highlighting the blend of wonder, fantasy, and the raw realities of nature in a child's perception.

It begins with her profound awe for the Bishop, viewing him as a holy, sky-connected figure, which contrasts with his polite, yet dismissive, interaction when she tries to share her joy about her new canary. The narrative then shifts to the family's 'hybrid' religious life, meticulously adhering to Father's stern Presbyterianism on Sunday mornings and Mother's gentle Anglicanism in the evenings. The children endure the long Presbyterian sermons but look forward to the Anglican service, especially the Bishop's 'splendid' blessing. This duality highlights the different facets of Victorian religious practice and its impact on children.

This scene highlights the quiet resilience and longing for home among the early settlers. The module also explores Small's persistent desire for a dog, using the 'Praying Chair' in a childlike ritual, and the eventual, somewhat complicated, fulfillment of this lifelong wish.

The Cranes' household is portrayed as a place of stark contrasts to Small's home, with its formal routines, taxidermy, and Mr. Crane's hunting 'sport.' Small finds comfort in the family dog, Cricket, and experiences various forms of discipline and misunderstanding. Incidents like the braided antimacassar and the castor oil given to a hen highlight Mrs. Crane's rigidness and Small's developing empathy and independence. The module concludes with Small's profound, if reluctant, shift in understanding Mrs. Crane, recognizing a hidden warmth beneath her stern exterior, even as she expresses longing for her own home.

Here, the 'mauvy-pink flower' (Rocket) and the translucent white currants become catalysts for her private fantasies of flying on white horses with an unseen boy. The sensory details—the scent of the flowers, the hum of bees, the shimmering butterflies—blend into a singular, beautiful experience, almost revealing a 'secret' about life itself. However, these moments of profound immersion are consistently shattered by the abrupt calls of grown-ups, pulling Small back to the mundane reality of garden chores.

Lizzie, at eight, embodies the desire to conform and be 'decent,' constantly mortified by Small's innocent but 'vulgar' actions, such as touching the cab's interior with gloved hands, spilling cocoa, and eating with her mouth full. The narrative details the games, the food, and the interactions with the adult hosts, emphasizing the chasm between adult expectations and a child's natural impulses. Despite Lizzie's attempts to control her younger sister, Small's uninhibited enjoyment and eventual defiance reveal a deeper, less conformist spirit.
