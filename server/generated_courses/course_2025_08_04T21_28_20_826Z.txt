The physical geography of the James' Bay district is vividly depicted, including the mud flats, the iconic Dallas Road pleasure drive, Beacon Hill Park, and the distant Olympic mountains. It highlights the smells of the mud flats and the beauty of the wild roses. The module also recounts the profound 'Silence' of the Western forests, contrasting it with the sounds of civilization and the determination of 'Pioneers' who toiled to clear and cultivate the land, often in the face of daunting natural obstacles.

### notes - This module illustrates the commercial and social landscape of early Victoria, highlighting its 'slow' and 'chewing' nature in adapting to new developments. It describes the omnipresent saloons, initially mistaken by Small as belonging to the Navy, and the strict societal rules forbidding children from looking at them. The module differentiates between town saloons and more attractive 'road-houses' along driving roads, which often featured gardens and caged animals, tempting curious children. Transportation is detailed, from the widespread practice of cows roaming plank sidewalks to the various horse-drawn vehicles like chaises and high dog-carts, emphasizing that driving was more for pleasure than speed. It reveals Victoria's unique pace, often deemed 'sleepy' by Americans, and the local preference for durable English goods over 'jerry-built' American ones. The heart of Victoria's commerce is depicted through Father's deep, dark wholesale store on Wharf Street, filled with stacked provisions and presided over by 'wholesale cats.' The module contrasts the orderly, English-influenced business practices with the organic, cow-laid street patterns of the town's outer areas, painting a picture of a developing city clinging to its traditional roots.

### notes - This module explores the intricate social fabric of early Victoria, focusing on community interactions, the evolving role of women, and the significant presence of diverse cultural groups. It highlights the custom of 'Visiting Matrons' who brought their entire families for all-day calls, adapting to the lack of easy transportation. The module contrasts the structured social visits with the daily challenges faced by women, particularly in managing households with 'green little Chinese boys' as servants, who were patiently taught Canadian ways while maintaining their own culture. It further delves into the broader interactions between Chinese and Indian populations and the White settlers, noting the different cultural approaches to labor, wealth, and nature. The poignant story of an Indian family rescuing a stranded Chinaman, sharing a 'Cup of Tea' in silent gratitude, underscores themes of inter-cultural aid and universal human needs despite language barriers. This section paints a picture of a developing society where necessity often forged unexpected bonds and revealed underlying human kindness.

It describes the prominence of Christ Church Cathedral and the ideological 'clash of conscience' that led to the formation of the Reformed Episcopal Church, which Small's family attended. Cemetery customs are explored, from the unique features of the Quadra Street Cemetery (Chinese altars, distinct burial sections) to the mournful funeral processions heading to Ross Bay Cemetery. The module critiques Victoria's education system, contrasting the 'ultra-genteel' English Ladies' Academies focused on manners with the 'free school' public system that taught 'book learning.' It touches upon the family's choice to send the younger children to public school despite societal criticism. Christmas traditions are vividly painted, from homemade gifts and fir tree decorations to festive shop windows and plum puddings. The narrative captures the mix of joy, commercial display, and the macabre aspects of a butcher shop at Christmas. Finally, the module details the exhilarating annual Regatta at the Gorge, a significant public event featuring Navy and Indigenous canoe races, concluding with the cruel 'greased pole' pig contest, revealing a less refined side of public entertainment.

## Module 7: Unique Characters and Urban Development

### notes - This final module concludes the narrative by describing the unique 'Characters' who populated Victoria, often eccentric or 'derelict' individuals who found their way to the 'Crown Colony' from England or were part of the local fabric. It highlights the tolerance, if not always understanding, with which Victorians viewed these figures, from homesick 'family remnants' to Elizabeth Pickering and Old Teenie, who embody the city's peculiar charm. The module transitions into the theme of 'Loyalty,' particularly to the Queen and England, as seen through May 24th celebrations and Mrs. Mitchell's deep connection to the Royal Family, which humanized royalty for Small. It then details the city's progress through its changing infrastructure and services: the evolution of healthcare with the 'Doctor and Dentist,' the transition from wells to modern 'Waterworks' and sewerage, and the impact of these changes on daily life and the urban landscape. The 'Chain Gang' exemplifies early civic works, contrasting manual labor with the introduction of machinery. The transformation of 'Cook Street' from a boggy rubbish dump to a paved residential area or Chinese market gardens illustrates the city's constant evolution. Finally, 'Grown Up' reflects on Victoria's growth from a 'lying-down cow' to a developing city, comparing its steady, English-influenced pace to Vancouver's faster, more 'new-world' development, and the eventual modernizations like the Empress Hotel, causeway, and changing harbor, all while retaining its tranquil Island setting.
