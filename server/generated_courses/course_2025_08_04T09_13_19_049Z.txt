# Life in Early Victoria: Insights from The Book of Small

## Module 1: Childhood Sundays and Religious Observances

### notes - This module explores the strict, ritualistic nature of Sundays in Emily Carr's childhood home in Victoria, British Columbia. Saturday nights were dedicated to preparations, including bathing in a large wooden tub and putting away toys. Sundays began with Father's camphor scent and solemn family prayers, followed by church attendance at Dr. Reid's Presbyterian Church. Father, a staunch Englishman, valued order and tradition, evident in the cold mutton Sunday dinner and the rigorous sermon recitation. Mother, being more delicate, preferred the Anglican evening service, which was a gentler privilege. The module highlights the contrast between the rigid Presbyterian observances and the more relaxed, musical Anglican services, and the protagonist Small's personal experiences, including her rebellious spirit against the strictures and her vivid observations of family members and surroundings like the 'lily field.' The chapter 'The Blessing' reinforces the hybrid religious life, emphasizing the differing atmospheres of morning Presbyterian services and evening Anglican ones, and the symbolic 'blessing' carried home.
