## Module 2: A Child's Domestic World & Early Lessons

### notes - This module deeply explores the strict, ritualized domestic life of a Victorian child named Small, likely Emily Carr herself, in Victoria, BC. Sundays are depicted as rigidly structured, from the meticulous Saturday night baths with "brown Windsor soap" and cold house dashes, to stiff church clothes, lengthy sermons, and solemn evening Bible readings. The Father's stern, English-centric demeanor dictates much of the household's routine, emphasizing order and piety. However, Small finds solace and joy in the "Cow Yard," a space of freedom and connection with animals like the Cow, rooster, and hens, where her uninhibited "cow-songs" often contrast with her family's social anxieties. Her relationship with the "Praying Chair" highlights a child's imaginative coping with unmet desires, while the "Killing Tree" offers an early, unsettling encounter with death and mystery. Social lessons, such as Lizzie's shame over Small's boisterous party behavior, underscore the pervasive emphasis on proper conduct. Through these experiences, the module paints a vivid picture of a childhood navigating the tension between rigid societal expectations and personal expression.

## Module 5: Victoria's Transformation and Legacy

### notes - This module encapsulates Victoria's transition from a sleepy "Old Country"-loyal town to a growing, modern city, as seen through the lens of memory and change. It vividly contrasts Victoria's initial slow pace and strong English identity with the rapid development of its rival, Vancouver, and the eventual modernization that reshaped its landscape. Key transformations include the building of grand Parliament Buildings, the replacement of the old wooden James' Bay bridge with a concrete causeway, and the construction of the iconic Empress Hotel on reclaimed land that was once a garbage dump. These changes, driven partly by the Canadian Pacific Railway, signify Victoria's reluctant embrace of progress and a shift from its strict colonial past. The module notes the disappearance of old landmarks, social customs, and even the natural features, such as the Gorge becoming industrialized. While Victoria maintains its tranquil, deliberate nature, it acknowledges its evolution from a "lying-down cow" chewing cud to a city adapting to the demands of the West, demonstrating a complex legacy of preserving tradition amidst inevitable growth.
